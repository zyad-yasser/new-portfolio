# Implementing Network Segmentation with Firewall Zones

## Overview

Network segmentation divides a flat network into isolated security zones with firewall-enforced boundaries to contain breaches, restrict lateral movement, and enforce least-privilege access between workloads. Segmentation is a foundational control required by PCI DSS, HIPAA, NIST 800-53, and zero trust architectures. Modern segmentation combines traditional VLAN-based approaches with microsegmentation at the workload level for granular east-west traffic control. This skill covers designing zone architectures, configuring inter-zone firewall policies, implementing VLAN segmentation on switches, and deploying microsegmentation for dynamic environments.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing network segmentation with firewall zones capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Network topology documentation with asset inventory
- Firewall supporting zone-based policies (Palo Alto, Fortinet, Cisco Firepower)
- Managed switches with VLAN support (802.1Q trunking)
- Traffic flow documentation or NetFlow data for baseline analysis
- Compliance requirements (PCI DSS scope, HIPAA ePHI boundaries)

## Core Concepts

### Zone Architecture Tiers

| Zone | Trust Level | Examples | Access Policy |
|------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Internet** | None | Public internet | Default deny inbound |
| **DMZ** | Low | Web servers, mail relays, DNS | Limited inbound, restricted outbound |
| **Guest** | Low | Guest WiFi, visitor network | Internet only, no internal access |
| **Corporate** | Medium | Employee workstations, printers | Controlled access to internal resources |
| **Server/Data Center** | High | Application servers, databases | Strict ACLs, limited admin access |
| **PCI CDE** | Critical | Payment systems, card data | PCI DSS compliant isolation |
| **Management** | Critical | Network devices, hypervisors, IPMI | Highly restricted, jump box only |
| **OT/SCADA** | Critical | Industrial control systems | Air-gapped or strictly firewalled |

### Segmentation Approaches

| Approach | Scope | Granularity | Use Case |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **VLAN Segmentation** | Layer 2 | Subnet-level | Department separation, guest isolation |
| **Firewall Zones** | Layer 3-7 | Zone-to-zone | Inter-zone policy enforcement |
| **ACLs on Routers** | Layer 3-4 | Subnet/port | Quick filtering at routing boundaries |
| **Microsegmentation** | Layer 3-7 | Workload-level | Zero trust, container environments |
| **SGT/TrustSec** | Layer 2-7 | Tag-based | Identity-based segmentation |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Map Traffic Flows and Define Zones

Before implementing segmentation, capture baseline traffic:

```bash
# Capture NetFlow data to understand existing traffic patterns
nfdump -R /var/cache/nfdump/ -s srcip/bytes -n 50

# Identify east-west traffic between subnets
nfdump -R /var/cache/nfdump/ -s record/bytes \
  'src net 10.0.0.0/8 and dst net 10.0.0.0/8' -n 100

# Map application dependencies
# Document which servers need to communicate with which other servers
```

### Step 2: Configure VLANs on Switches

```
! Core switch VLAN configuration
vlan 10
 name Management
vlan 20
 name Corporate-Users
vlan 30
 name Servers
vlan 40
 name PCI-CDE
vlan 50
 name Guest
vlan 60
 name DMZ
vlan 99
 name Native-Unused

! Trunk port to firewall
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 description Trunk-to-Firewall
 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40,50,60
 switchport trunk native vlan 99
 switchport nonegotiate

! Access port for corporate users
interface range GigabitEthernet1/0/2-24
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20
 spanning-tree portfast

! Access port for servers
interface range GigabitEthernet1/0/25-36
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 30

! Prevent VLAN hopping
interface range GigabitEthernet1/0/37-48
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 99
 shutdown
```

### Step 3: Configure Firewall Zone Policies

**Palo Alto zone-based policy:**

```
# Define zones on firewall sub-interfaces
set network interface ethernet ethernet1/1 layer3 units ethernet1/1.10 tag 10 ip 10.0.10.1/24
set network interface ethernet ethernet1/1 layer3 units ethernet1/1.20 tag 20 ip 10.0.20.1/24
set network interface ethernet ethernet1/1 layer3 units ethernet1/1.30 tag 30 ip 10.0.30.1/24
set network interface ethernet ethernet1/1 layer3 units ethernet1/1.40 tag 40 ip 10.0.40.1/24

set zone Management network layer3 ethernet1/1.10
set zone Corporate network layer3 ethernet1/1.20
set zone Servers network layer3 ethernet1/1.30
set zone PCI-CDE network layer3 ethernet1/1.40

# Inter-zone policies (deny by default, explicitly allow)

# Corporate -> Servers (only specific apps)
set rulebase security rules Corp-to-Servers from Corporate to Servers
set rulebase security rules Corp-to-Servers application [ web-browsing ssl dns smtp ]
set rulebase security rules Corp-to-Servers action allow
set rulebase security rules Corp-to-Servers profile-setting group Standard-Profiles

# Corporate -> PCI (DENY)
set rulebase security rules Corp-to-PCI from Corporate to PCI-CDE
set rulebase security rules Corp-to-PCI action deny log-end yes

# Servers -> PCI (only payment processing)
set rulebase security rules Servers-to-PCI from Servers to PCI-CDE
set rulebase security rules Servers-to-PCI source [ 10.0.30.10 ]
set rulebase security rules Servers-to-PCI destination [ 10.0.40.10 ]
set rulebase security rules Servers-to-PCI application [ ssl ]
set rulebase security rules Servers-to-PCI service service-https
set rulebase security rules Servers-to-PCI action allow

# Management -> All (admin access via jump box)
set rulebase security rules Mgmt-Admin from Management to [ Servers PCI-CDE ]
set rulebase security rules Mgmt-Admin source [ 10.0.10.50 ]
set rulebase security rules Mgmt-Admin application [ ssh rdp ]
set rulebase security rules Mgmt-Admin source-user [ admin-group ]
set rulebase security rules Mgmt-Admin action allow

# Intra-zone deny (prevent lateral movement within zone)
set rulebase security rules Deny-Intrazone from Corporate to Corporate
set rulebase security rules Deny-Intrazone action deny log-end yes

# Default deny all
set rulebase security rules Deny-All from any to any
set rulebase security rules Deny-All action deny log-end yes
```

### Step 4: Implement Inter-VLAN Routing ACLs

For additional layer 3 filtering on the router/L3 switch:

```
! ACL: Corporate can only reach specific server ports
ip access-list extended CORP-TO-SERVERS
 permit tcp 10.0.20.0 0.0.0.255 10.0.30.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80
 permit tcp 10.0.20.0 0.0.0.255 10.0.30.0 0.0.0.255 eq 443
 permit tcp 10.0.20.0 0.0.0.255 10.0.30.0 0.0.0.255 eq 25
 permit udp 10.0.20.0 0.0.0.255 10.0.30.10 0.0.0.0 eq 53
 deny ip 10.0.20.0 0.0.0.255 10.0.30.0 0.0.0.255 log

! ACL: PCI CDE isolation
ip access-list extended PCI-ISOLATION
 permit tcp host 10.0.30.10 host 10.0.40.10 eq 443
 permit tcp 10.0.10.50 0.0.0.0 10.0.40.0 0.0.0.255 eq 22
 deny ip any 10.0.40.0 0.0.0.255 log

! Apply ACLs to VLAN interfaces
interface Vlan20
 ip address 10.0.20.1 255.255.255.0
 ip access-group CORP-TO-SERVERS out

interface Vlan40
 ip address 10.0.40.1 255.255.255.0
 ip access-group PCI-ISOLATION in
```

### Step 5: Validate Segmentation

    def run_validation(self):

        # Tests that SHOULD be blocked

            print(f"\n[!] FAILED TESTS:")
            for r in self.results:

## Best Practices

- **Default Deny** - Start with deny-all inter-zone rules and explicitly allow required traffic
- **Document Flows** - Map all legitimate traffic flows before implementing restrictions
- **Segment by Sensitivity** - Group assets by data classification and compliance scope
- **Intra-Zone Control** - Block lateral movement within zones, not just between zones
- **Limit Management Access** - Restrict management plane to a dedicated zone with jump boxes
- **Regular Validation** - Test segmentation controls quarterly with automated tools
- **Monitor Denied Traffic** - Log and review denied inter-zone traffic for policy refinement
- **PCI Scope Reduction** - Use segmentation to minimize PCI DSS Cardholder Data Environment scope
