# Auditing Cloud with CIS Benchmarks

## When to Use

- When performing initial security audits of cloud environments against industry-standard benchmarks
- When preparing for SOC 2, ISO 27001, or regulatory audits that reference CIS controls
- When establishing a measurable security baseline for new cloud accounts or subscriptions
- When tracking compliance improvement over time with periodic reassessment
- When evaluating the security posture of acquired or inherited cloud environments

**Do not use** for runtime threat detection (see detecting-cloud-threats-with-guardduty), for application-level security testing (see conducting-cloud-penetration-testing), or for compliance frameworks not based on CIS (refer to specific regulatory skill files).

## Prerequisites

- Read-only access to target cloud accounts (AWS SecurityAudit policy, Azure Reader role, GCP Viewer role)
- Prowler, ScoutSuite, or cloud-native CSPM tools installed and configured
- Understanding of CIS benchmark structure: sections, controls, profiles (Level 1 and Level 2)
- Remediation access for implementing fixes (separate from audit credentials)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Select Appropriate CIS Benchmark Version

Choose the correct benchmark version for each cloud provider. Current versions as of 2025 include CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v5.0, CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark v4.0, and CIS GCP Foundations Benchmark v4.0.

```
CIS Benchmark Coverage Areas:
+-------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| Section           | AWS v5.0                | Azure v4.0             |
+-------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| Identity & Access | IAM policies, MFA, root | Azure AD, RBAC, PIM    |
| Logging           | CloudTrail, Config      | Activity Log, Diag     |
| Monitoring        | CloudWatch alarms       | Defender, Sentinel     |
| Networking        | VPC, SG, NACLs         | NSG, ASG, Firewall     |
| Storage           | S3 encryption, access   | Storage encryption     |
| Database          | RDS encryption          | SQL TDE, auditing      |
+-------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+

CIS Profile Levels:
  Level 1: Practical security settings that can be implemented without significant
           performance impact or reduced functionality
  Level 2: Defense-in-depth settings that may reduce functionality or require
           additional planning for implementation
```

### Step 2: Run Automated Assessment with Prowler

Execute comprehensive CIS benchmark scans using Prowler for automated control evaluation across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

```bash
# AWS CIS v5.0 assessment
prowler aws \
  --compliance cis_5.0_aws \
  --profile audit-account \
  --output-formats json-ocsf,html,csv \
  --output-directory ./cis-audit-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Azure CIS v4.0 assessment
prowler azure \
  --compliance cis_4.0_azure \
  --subscription-ids "sub-id-1,sub-id-2" \
  --output-formats json-ocsf,html,csv \
  --output-directory ./cis-audit-azure-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# GCP CIS v4.0 assessment
prowler gcp \
  --compliance cis_4.0_gcp \
  --project-ids "project-1,project-2" \
  --output-formats json-ocsf,html,csv \
  --output-directory ./cis-audit-gcp-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Multi-account AWS scan using ScoutSuite
scout suite aws \
  --profile audit-account \
  --report-dir ./scout-report \
  --ruleset cis-5.0 \
  --force
```

### Step 3: Interpret Results and Prioritize Remediation

Analyze audit results by section and severity. Prioritize Level 1 controls first as they represent fundamental security hygiene, then address Level 2 controls for defense in depth.

```bash
# Parse Prowler results for failed controls
cat ./cis-audit-*/prowler-output-*.json | \
  jq '[.[] | select(.StatusExtended == "FAIL")] | group_by(.CheckID) |
  map({control: .[0].CheckID, description: .[0].CheckTitle,
  failed_resources: length, severity: .[0].Severity}) |
  sort_by(-.failed_resources)'

# Generate compliance score by section
cat ./cis-audit-*/prowler-output-*.json | \
  jq 'group_by(.Section) | map({
    section: .[0].Section,
    total: length,
    passed: [.[] | select(.StatusExtended == "PASS")] | length,
    failed: [.[] | select(.StatusExtended == "FAIL")] | length,
    score: (([.[] | select(.StatusExtended == "PASS")] | length) / length * 100 | round)
  })'
```

### Step 4: Remediate Critical and High Controls

Address failed controls starting with the highest impact items. Use AWS Config remediation, Azure Policy, or Terraform to apply fixes systematically.

```bash
# CIS 1.4: Ensure no root account access key exists
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name root
# If keys exist, delete them
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name root --access-key-id AKIAEXAMPLE

# CIS 2.1.1: Ensure S3 bucket default encryption is enabled
for bucket in $(aws s3api list-buckets --query 'Buckets[*].Name' --output text); do
  aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket "$bucket" \
    --server-side-encryption-configuration '{
      "Rules": [{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {"SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"}}]
    }' 2>/dev/null && echo "Encrypted: $bucket" || echo "FAILED: $bucket"
done

# CIS 3.1: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
aws cloudtrail create-trail \
  --name organization-trail \
  --s3-bucket-name cloudtrail-logs-bucket \
  --is-multi-region-trail \
  --enable-log-file-validation \
  --kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/key-id

aws cloudtrail start-logging --name organization-trail

# CIS 4.x: Configure CloudWatch metric filters and alarms
aws logs put-metric-filter \
  --log-group-name CloudTrail/DefaultLogGroup \
  --filter-name UnauthorizedAPICalls \
  --filter-pattern '{ ($.errorCode = "*UnauthorizedAccess*") || ($.errorCode = "AccessDenied*") }' \
  --metric-transformations metricName=UnauthorizedAPICalls,metricNamespace=CISBenchmark,metricValue=1
```

### Step 5: Establish Continuous Compliance Monitoring

Deploy automated compliance monitoring to detect configuration drift between periodic audits. Use AWS Security Hub, Azure Policy, or GCP Security Command Center.

```bash
# AWS: Enable CIS v5.0 in Security Hub
aws securityhub batch-enable-standards \
  --standards-subscription-requests '[
    {"StandardsArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:::ruleset/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/5.0.0"}
  ]'

# Azure: Assign CIS benchmark policy initiative
az policy assignment create \
  --name cis-azure-benchmark \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<sub-id>" \
  --policy-set-definition "1a5bb27d-173f-493e-9568-eb56638dbd0e" \
  --params '{"effect": {"value": "AuditIfNotExists"}}'

# Schedule periodic Prowler assessments
# Run weekly via cron or CI/CD pipeline
0 2 * * 1 prowler aws --compliance cis_5.0_aws --output-formats csv --output-directory /opt/audits/weekly-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d)
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Pre-Audit CIS Assessment for SOC 2 Certification

**Context**: A SaaS company pursuing SOC 2 Type II certification needs to demonstrate cloud security controls aligned to CIS benchmarks. The auditor requires evidence of continuous compliance monitoring across 45 AWS accounts.

**Approach**:
1. Run Prowler CIS v5.0 assessment across all 45 accounts to establish the baseline compliance score
2. Export results to CSV and categorize failures by section (IAM, Logging, Monitoring, Networking)
3. Map each CIS control to the relevant SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria (CC6.1, CC6.6, CC7.1, etc.)
4. Remediate all Level 1 control failures within 30 days and Level 2 within 60 days
5. Enable CIS v5.0 in AWS Security Hub for continuous monitoring and automated drift detection
6. Generate weekly compliance reports showing improvement trajectory for the auditor
7. Document exceptions for controls intentionally not implemented with risk acceptance justification

**Pitfalls**: Remediating controls without testing in a staging environment first can break production workloads. Ignoring Level 2 controls entirely weakens the audit narrative even if they are not strictly required.

Benchmark Version: CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v5.0
Accounts Assessed: 45
Assessment Date: 2025-02-23
Tool: Prowler v4.3.0

OVERALL COMPLIANCE SCORE: 74%

COMPLIANCE BY SECTION:
  1. Identity and Access Management:  68% (41/60 controls passed)
  2. Storage:                         82% (28/34 controls passed)
