# Implementing Zero Trust with HashiCorp Boundary

## Overview

HashiCorp Boundary is an identity-aware proxy that provides secure, zero trust access to infrastructure resources without traditional VPNs or direct network access. Boundary operates on a default-deny model -- users start with no access and must be explicitly granted permissions for specific resources. When integrated with HashiCorp Vault, Boundary can dynamically broker credentials, ensuring users never see or manage underlying secrets. This eliminates credential sprawl and enables just-in-time access with automatic credential revocation when sessions end. Boundary supports session recording for audit compliance, OIDC/LDAP authentication, and manages access through a hierarchical scope model of organizations and projects.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing zero trust with hashicorp boundary capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- HashiCorp Boundary server (self-hosted or HCP Boundary)
- HashiCorp Vault (for credential brokering)
- Identity provider supporting OIDC (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0)
- PostgreSQL database for Boundary's backend
- TLS certificates for secure communication
- Understanding of PKI and X.509 certificate management

### Vault Integration for Credential Brokering

```hcl
# Vault credential store
resource "boundary_credential_store_vault" "vault" {
  name        = "vault-store"
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.production.id
  address     = "https://vault.example.com:8200"
  token       = var.vault_token

  plugin_name = "aws"
  bucket_name = "boundary-session-recordings"
  attributes_json = jsonencode({
    "region"                      = "us-east-1"
    "disable_credential_rotation" = true
  })
  secrets_json = jsonencode({
    "access_key_id"     = var.aws_access_key
    "secret_access_key" = var.aws_secret_key
  })
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control

```hcl
# SRE team role - full production access
resource "boundary_role" "sre_production" {
  name          = "sre-production-access"
  scope_id      = boundary_scope.production.id
  grant_strings = [
    "ids=*;type=target;actions=list,read,authorize-session",
    "ids=*;type=session;actions=list,read,cancel",
    "ids=*;type=host;actions=list,read",
  ]
  principal_ids = [
    boundary_managed_group.sre_team.id
  ]
}

# Dev team role - limited access
resource "boundary_role" "dev_staging" {
  name          = "dev-staging-access"
  scope_id      = boundary_scope.production.id
  grant_strings = [
    "ids=${boundary_target.ssh_production.id};type=target;actions=read,authorize-session",
  ]
  principal_ids = [
    boundary_managed_group.dev_team.id
  ]
}
```

## Connecting to Targets

```bash
# Authenticate via OIDC
boundary authenticate oidc \
  -auth-method-id amoidc_xxxxx

# List available targets
boundary targets list -scope-id p_xxxxx

# Connect to SSH target (credentials injected by Vault)
boundary connect ssh \
  -target-id ttcp_xxxxx

# Connect to database (credentials brokered by Vault)
boundary connect postgres \
  -target-id ttcp_xxxxx \
  -dbname production

# Use Boundary Desktop client for GUI access
# Download from: https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/install
```

## Session Recording and Auditing

```bash
# List session recordings
boundary session-recordings list \
  -scope-id p_xxxxx

# Download session recording for review
boundary session-recordings download \
  -id sr_xxxxx \
  -output recording.cast

# Play back with asciinema
asciinema play recording.cast
```

## Dynamic Host Catalogs

```hcl
# AWS dynamic host catalog - auto-discovers EC2 instances
resource "boundary_host_catalog_plugin" "aws_catalog" {
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.production.id
  name        = "aws-production"
  plugin_name = "aws"

  attributes_json = jsonencode({
    "region"                      = "us-east-1"
    "disable_credential_rotation" = true
  })

  secrets_json = jsonencode({
    "access_key_id"     = var.aws_access_key
    "secret_access_key" = var.aws_secret_key
  })
}

resource "boundary_host_set_plugin" "web_tier" {
  host_catalog_id = boundary_host_catalog_plugin.aws_catalog.id
  name            = "web-tier"
  attributes_json = jsonencode({
    "filters" = [
      "tag:Environment=production",
      "tag:Tier=web"
    ]
  })
}
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use Vault KMS for key management** instead of static AEAD keys in production
2. **Enable session recording** for all privileged access targets
3. **Set session time limits** appropriate to the resource sensitivity
4. **Use OIDC managed groups** for automatic role assignment from IdP
5. **Deploy multi-hop workers** for accessing resources across network boundaries
6. **Rotate Vault tokens** used by credential stores regularly
7. **Enable audit logging** on both controllers and workers
8. **Use credential injection** (SSH certificates) over brokering when possible
9. **Implement least-privilege grants** -- avoid wildcard permissions
10. **Review session recordings** regularly for compliance and incident response
