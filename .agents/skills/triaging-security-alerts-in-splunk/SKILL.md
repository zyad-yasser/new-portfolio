# Triaging Security Alerts in Splunk

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- SOC Tier 1 analysts need to process the Incident Review queue in Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)
- Notable events require rapid severity classification and initial investigation before escalation
- Alert volume exceeds capacity and analysts need a systematic triage methodology
- Management requests metrics on alert disposition (true positive, false positive, benign)

**Do not use** for deep forensic investigation — escalate to Tier 2/3 after initial triage confirms malicious activity.

## Prerequisites

- Splunk Enterprise Security 7.x+ with Incident Review dashboard configured
- CIM-normalized data sources (Windows Event Logs, firewall, proxy, endpoint)
- Role with `ess_analyst` capability for notable event status updates
- Familiarity with SPL (Search Processing Language)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Access Incident Review and Prioritize Queue

Open the Incident Review dashboard in Splunk ES. Sort notable events by urgency (calculated from severity x priority). Apply filters to focus on unassigned events:

```spl
| `notable`
| search status="new" OR status="unassigned"
| sort - urgency
| table _time, rule_name, src, dest, user, urgency, status
| head 50
```

Focus on Critical and High urgency events first. Group related alerts by `src` or `dest` to identify attack chains rather than treating each alert independently.

### Step 2: Investigate the Notable Event Context

For each notable event, pivot to raw events. Example for a brute force alert:

```spl
index=wineventlog sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625
src_ip="192.168.1.105"
earliest=-1h latest=now
| stats count by src_ip, dest, user, status
| where count > 10
| sort - count
```

Check if the source IP is internal (lateral movement) or external (perimeter attack). Cross-reference with asset and identity lookups:

```spl
| `notable`
| search rule_name="Brute Force Access Behavior Detected"
| lookup asset_lookup_by_cidr ip AS src OUTPUT category, owner, priority
| lookup identity_lookup_expanded identity AS user OUTPUT department, managedBy
| table _time, src, dest, user, category, owner, department
```

### Step 3: Correlate Across Data Sources

Check if the same source appears in other telemetry:

```spl
index=proxy OR index=firewall src="192.168.1.105" earliest=-24h
| stats count by index, sourcetype, action, dest_port
| sort - count
```

Look for corroborating evidence: Did the same IP also trigger DNS anomalies, proxy blocks, or endpoint detection alerts?

```spl
index=main sourcetype="cisco:asa" src="192.168.1.105" action=blocked earliest=-24h
| timechart span=1h count by dest_port
```

### Step 4: Check Threat Intelligence Enrichment

Query the threat intelligence framework for known IOCs:

```spl
| `notable`
| search search_name="Threat - Threat Intelligence Match - Rule"
| lookup threat_intel_by_ip ip AS src OUTPUT threat_collection, threat_description, threat_key
| table _time, src, dest, threat_collection, threat_description, weight
| where weight >= 3
```

For domains, check against threat lists:

```spl
| tstats count from datamodel=Web where Web.url="*evil-domain.com*" by Web.src, Web.url, Web.status
| rename Web.* AS *
```

### Step 5: Classify and Disposition the Alert

Update the notable event status in Incident Review:

| Disposition | Criteria | Action |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **True Positive** | Corroborating evidence confirms malicious activity | Escalate to Tier 2, create incident ticket |
| **Benign True Positive** | Alert fired correctly but activity is authorized (e.g., pen test) | Close with comment, add suppression if recurring |
| **False Positive** | Alert logic matched benign behavior | Close, tune correlation search, document pattern |
| **Undetermined** | Insufficient data to classify | Assign to Tier 2 with investigation notes |

Update via Splunk ES UI or REST API:

```spl
| sendalert update_notable_event param.status="2" param.urgency="critical"
  param.comment="Confirmed brute force from compromised workstation. Escalated to IR-2024-0431."
  param.owner="analyst_jdoe"
```

### Step 6: Document Triage Findings

Record in the notable event comment field:
- Source/destination involved
- Data sources examined
- Correlation findings (related alerts, TI matches)
- Disposition rationale
- Next steps for escalation

```spl
| `notable`
| search rule_name="Brute Force*" status="closed"
| stats count by status_label, disposition
| addtotal
```

### Step 7: Track Triage Metrics

Monitor triage performance over time:

```spl
| `notable`
| where status_end > 0
| eval triage_time = status_end - _time
| stats avg(triage_time) AS avg_triage_sec, median(triage_time) AS med_triage_sec,
        count by rule_name, status_label
| eval avg_triage_min = round(avg_triage_sec/60, 1)
| sort - count
| table rule_name, status_label, count, avg_triage_min
```

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Notable Event** | Splunk ES alert generated by a correlation search that meets defined risk or threshold criteria |
| **Urgency** | Calculated field combining event severity with asset/identity priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Informational) |
| **Correlation Search** | Scheduled SPL query that detects threat patterns and generates notable events when conditions match |
| **CIM** | Common Information Model — Splunk's normalized field naming convention enabling cross-source queries |
| **Disposition** | Final classification of an alert: true positive, false positive, benign true positive, or undetermined |
| **MTTD/MTTR** | Mean Time to Detect / Mean Time to Respond — key SOC metrics measuring detection and resolution speed |

## Tools & Systems

- **Splunk Enterprise Security**: SIEM platform providing Incident Review dashboard, correlation searches, and risk-based alerting
- **Splunk SOAR (Phantom)**: Orchestration platform for automating triage playbooks and enrichment actions
- **Asset & Identity Framework**: Splunk ES lookup tables mapping IPs to asset owners and users to departments for context enrichment
- **Threat Intelligence Framework**: Splunk ES module ingesting STIX/TAXII feeds and matching IOCs against notable events

## Common Scenarios

- **Brute Force Alerts**: Correlate EventCode 4625 (failed logon) with 4624 (successful logon) from same source to determine if attack succeeded
- **Malware Detection**: Cross-reference endpoint AV alert with proxy logs for C2 callback confirmation
- **Data Exfiltration Alert**: Check outbound data volume from DLP and proxy logs against user baseline
- **Privilege Escalation**: Correlate EventCode 4672 (special privileges assigned) with 4720 (account created) from non-admin users
- **Lateral Movement**: Map EventCode 4648 (explicit credential logon) across multiple destinations from single source
