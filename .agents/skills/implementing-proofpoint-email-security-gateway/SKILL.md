# Implementing Proofpoint Email Security Gateway

## Overview
Proofpoint Email Protection is a cloud-native secure email gateway (SEG) that acts as a security checkpoint where all inbound and outbound mail traffic routes through the gateway before reaching user inboxes. It combines signature-based detection for known malware, machine learning algorithms for emerging threats, real-time threat intelligence feeds, URL rewriting with time-of-click sandboxing, and behavioral analysis for BEC detection. Proofpoint processes over 2.8 billion emails daily and blocks over 1 million extortion attempts per day.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing proofpoint email security gateway capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites
- Proofpoint Email Protection license (PPS on-premises or Proofpoint on Demand cloud)
- Administrative access to DNS management for MX record changes
- Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace email environment
- Understanding of mail flow architecture and SPF/DKIM/DMARC
- Network firewall rules permitting Proofpoint IP ranges

## Key Concepts

### Deployment Models
1. **MX-Based Gateway (Traditional SEG)**: All mail routes through Proofpoint via MX record changes; intercepts threats before delivery
2. **API-Based Integration**: Connects directly to Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace via API; no MX changes required; can be operational within 48 hours
3. **Hybrid Deployment**: Combines gateway and API for layered protection

### Core Detection Technologies
- **Impostor Classifier**: ML model detecting BEC/impersonation with no malicious URLs or attachments
- **URL Defense**: Rewrites URLs and performs real-time sandboxing at time of click
- **Attachment Defense**: Sandboxes suspicious attachments in virtual environments
- **Nexus Threat Graph**: Cross-customer threat intelligence correlation engine
- **Supplier Threat Detection**: Identifies compromised vendor email accounts

### Protection Layers
| Layer | Technology | Threat Type |
|---|---|---|
| Connection | IP reputation, rate limiting | Spam botnets |
| Authentication | SPF, DKIM, DMARC enforcement | Spoofing |
| Content | ML classifiers, NLP analysis | BEC, phishing |
| URL | Rewriting + time-of-click sandbox | Credential theft |
| Attachment | Static + dynamic sandboxing | Malware, ransomware |
| Post-delivery | TRAP (auto-retraction) | Weaponized after delivery |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Plan Mail Flow Architecture
- Document current MX records and mail flow path
- Identify all legitimate sending sources (marketing platforms, CRM, ticketing systems)
- Map inbound connectors and transport rules in Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace
- Plan IP allowlisting for Proofpoint egress IPs on receiving infrastructure
- Configure SPF record to include Proofpoint: `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:spf-a.proofpoint.com -all`

### Step 2: Configure Proofpoint Policies
- Create organizational units matching business structure
- Define inbound mail policies: anti-spam, anti-virus, impostor detection
- Configure Smart Search quarantine with end-user digest notifications
- Set up Proofpoint Encryption for sensitive outbound messages
- Enable Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) for URL and attachment sandboxing

### Step 3: Deploy Email Authentication
- Configure DKIM signing through Proofpoint for outbound messages
- Set DMARC policy to monitor mode initially: `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@company.com`
- Enable inbound DMARC enforcement to reject spoofed messages
- Configure anti-spoofing rules for executive impersonation protection

### Step 4: Enable Advanced Threat Protection
- Activate URL Defense with rewriting enabled for all inbound messages
- Configure Attachment Defense sandbox policies (safe attachment mode)
- Enable Threat Response Auto-Pull (TRAP) for post-delivery remediation
- Set up TAP Dashboard alerts for targeted attack campaigns
- Configure Supplier Risk monitoring for vendor email compromise

### Step 5: Migrate MX Records
- Lower MX record TTL to 300 seconds 48 hours before cutover
- Update MX records to point to Proofpoint: `company-com.mail.protection.proofpoint.com`
- Configure connector restrictions in Microsoft 365 to accept mail only from Proofpoint IPs
- Monitor mail flow through Proofpoint Message Trace for 48-72 hours
- Verify no legitimate mail is being blocked or delayed

### Step 6: Tune and Optimize
- Review quarantine and false positive/negative rates weekly for first month
- Adjust spam thresholds based on organizational tolerance
- Add approved senders and safe lists for legitimate bulk mail
- Configure data loss prevention (DLP) rules for outbound sensitive content
- Enable email warning banners for external sender identification

## Tools & Resources
- **Proofpoint TAP Dashboard**: Real-time threat visibility and campaign tracking
- **Proofpoint TRAP**: Automated post-delivery email retraction
- **Proofpoint SER (Spam/End-user Release)**: Self-service quarantine management
- **Proofpoint Closed-Loop Email Analysis (CLEAR)**: Phishing report button integration
- **MX Toolbox**: DNS record verification and mail flow testing

## Validation
- All inbound email routes through Proofpoint (verify MX records and message headers)
- TAP Dashboard shows threat detections and blocked campaigns
- URL Defense rewrites links in test messages and sandboxes at click time
- Attachment Defense detonates test malware samples in sandbox
- TRAP successfully retracts test phishing message from inboxes post-delivery
- False positive rate below 0.1% after initial tuning period
- DMARC/SPF/DKIM authentication passes for all legitimate outbound mail
