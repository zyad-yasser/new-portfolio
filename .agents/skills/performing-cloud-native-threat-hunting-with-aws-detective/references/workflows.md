# AWS Detective Investigation Workflow

## Phase 1: Triage
1. Review GuardDuty HIGH/CRITICAL findings
2. Open Detective console → Finding Groups
3. Identify clustered findings pointing to same entity

## Phase 2: Entity Investigation
1. Select entity (IAM user/role, EC2, IP)
2. Review 24h behavior timeline
3. Identify unusual API calls, new geolocations, impossible travel
4. Check for privilege escalation patterns (CreateAccessKey, AttachPolicy)

## Phase 3: Scope Assessment
1. Trace lateral movement via AssumeRole chains
2. Check S3 data access patterns
3. Review VPC Flow Logs for unusual outbound connections
4. Identify all compromised credentials

## Phase 4: Correlation
1. Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
2. Build attack timeline from entity profiles
3. Identify initial access vector
4. Document indicators of compromise (IOCs)

## Phase 5: Response
1. Preserve evidence (CloudTrail logs, flow logs, snapshots) when safe
2. Disable compromised credentials
3. Revoke active sessions
4. Isolate affected resources
5. If active impact is ongoing, contain first and document evidence trade-offs
