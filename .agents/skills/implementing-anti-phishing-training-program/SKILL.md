# Implementing Anti-Phishing Training Program

## Overview
Security awareness training is the human layer of phishing defense. An effective anti-phishing training program combines regular simulations, interactive learning modules, metric tracking, and positive reinforcement to build a security-conscious culture. This skill covers designing, deploying, and measuring a comprehensive phishing awareness program using platforms like KnowBe4, Proofpoint Security Awareness, and open-source alternatives.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing anti phishing training program capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites
- Management buy-in and budget approval
- Security awareness training platform (KnowBe4, Proofpoint SAT, Cofense)
- Employee email list and organizational structure
- Baseline phishing susceptibility data (from initial simulation)
- Learning management system (LMS) integration capability

## Key Concepts

### Training Program Pillars
1. **Baseline Assessment**: Initial phishing simulation to measure current susceptibility
2. **Interactive Training**: Role-based modules covering phishing identification
3. **Regular Simulations**: Monthly/quarterly phishing tests with progressive difficulty
4. **Just-in-Time Learning**: Immediate training after a user fails a simulation
5. **Positive Reinforcement**: Recognition for reporting phishing correctly
6. **Metrics & Reporting**: Track improvement over time by department and role

### SANS Security Awareness Maturity Model
- **Level 1**: Non-existent - No program
- **Level 2**: Compliance-focused - Annual checkbox training
- **Level 3**: Promoting Awareness - Engaging, regular content
- **Level 4**: Long-term Sustainment - Continuous program with culture change
- **Level 5**: Metrics Framework - Risk-based measurement and optimization

## Workflow

### Step 1: Establish Baseline
- Run initial phishing simulation across all departments
- Measure click rate, submit rate, and report rate
- Identify high-risk departments and roles

### Step 2: Design Curriculum
- **General awareness**: Phishing identification basics for all employees
- **Role-specific**: Finance (BEC/wire fraud), IT (credential phishing), Executives (whaling)
- **Progressive difficulty**: Beginner, intermediate, advanced modules
- **Micro-learning**: Short (3-5 minute) frequent sessions vs. annual marathon

### Step 3: Deploy Training Platform
- Configure KnowBe4/Proofpoint SAT with organizational groups
- Set up automated enrollment workflows
- Integrate with LMS for completion tracking
- Configure reporting dashboards

### Step 4: Run Continuous Simulations
- Monthly simulations with varied scenarios
- Increase difficulty based on organizational performance
- Include diverse attack types: links, attachments, QR codes, BEC

### Step 5: Measure and Optimize
Use `scripts/process.py` to analyze training completion, simulation results, and program effectiveness over time.
