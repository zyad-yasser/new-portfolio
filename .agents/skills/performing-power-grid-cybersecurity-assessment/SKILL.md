# Performing Power Grid Cybersecurity Assessment

## When to Use

- When conducting periodic cybersecurity assessments of power grid facilities per NERC CIP requirements
- When assessing substation automation systems using IEC 61850 GOOSE and MMS protocols
- When evaluating the security of an Energy Management System (EMS) or SCADA control center
- When assessing synchrophasor (PMU) networks and wide-area monitoring systems
- When preparing for regional entity compliance audits or internal security reviews

**Do not use** for non-BES systems below NERC registration thresholds, for general OT assessment without power grid specifics (see performing-ot-network-security-assessment), or for physical security assessment of generation facilities without cyber scope.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of electric power grid architecture (generation, transmission, distribution)
- Familiarity with NERC CIP standards and BES Cyber System categorization
- Knowledge of power grid protocols (IEC 61850, IEC 60870-5-104, DNP3, ICCP/TASE.2)
- Passive monitoring tools for substation network traffic analysis
- Access to EMS/SCADA architecture documentation and network diagrams

## Workflow

### Step 1: Map Power Grid Cyber Architecture

Identify and document all cyber systems supporting grid operations including EMS, SCADA, substation automation, and communication infrastructure.

```yaml

    - vendor: "Siemens"
      product: "SICAM A8000"
      protocol: "IEC 60870-5-104"
      count: 20

  communications:
    primary: "MPLS WAN (carrier-provided)"
    backup: "Licensed microwave radio"
    last_mile: "Fiber optic to substation"

  pmu_count: 75
  pdc: "GE PDC (Phasor Data Concentrator)"
  communication: "IEEE C37.118.2 over dedicated network"
  data_rate: "30-60 samples per second"
```

### Step 2: Assess Substation Automation Security

Evaluate IEC 61850-based substation automation for protocol security, access controls, and network segmentation.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Power Grid Substation Security Assessor.

Evaluates security of IEC 61850-based substation automation
systems including GOOSE messaging, MMS client/server, and
network architecture.

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| IEC 61850 | International standard for communication networks and systems in substations, using GOOSE for protection signaling and MMS for SCADA data |
| GOOSE | Generic Object Oriented Substation Event - multicast protocol for fast peer-to-peer protection signaling between IEDs (< 4ms trip time) |
| MMS | Manufacturing Message Specification - client/server protocol for reading/writing IED data and operating circuit breakers |
| IEC 62351 | Security standard series for power system communication protocols providing authentication and encryption for IEC 61850, DNP3, and IEC 104 |
| ICCP/TASE.2 | Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol for data exchange between control centers of different utilities |
| Synchrophasor (PMU) | Phasor Measurement Unit providing time-synchronized voltage/current measurements at 30-60 samples/second for wide-area monitoring |

## Tools & Systems

- **Dragos Platform**: OT security platform with specific threat intelligence on power grid-targeting groups (ELECTRUM, KAMACITE)
- **SEL-3620 Ethernet Security Gateway**: Substation security device providing encryption, access control, and intrusion detection
- **GRIDsure**: Power grid cybersecurity assessment framework by Idaho National Laboratory
- **Wireshark with IEC 61850 Dissector**: Protocol analysis for GOOSE and MMS traffic in substations
