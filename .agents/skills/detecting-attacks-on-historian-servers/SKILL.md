# Detecting Attacks on Historian Servers

## When to Use

- When monitoring historian servers that bridge IT and OT networks for compromise indicators
- When detecting unauthorized queries or data manipulation in process historian databases
- When investigating lateral movement through historian servers between IT and OT zones
- When responding to alerts about exploitation of historian-specific vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-0921)
- When validating historian data integrity after a suspected OT security incident

**Do not use** for general database security monitoring (see database security skills), for historian deployment and configuration, or for IT-only data warehouse security.

## Prerequisites

- Historian server inventory (OSIsoft PI, Ignition, GE Proficy, Wonderware InSQL)
- Network monitoring on historian network segments (both IT-facing and OT-facing interfaces)
- Historian API access for data integrity validation
- Baseline of normal historian query patterns (which applications query which tags)
- Understanding of historian architecture (data sources, interfaces, client connections)

## Workflow

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

lateral movement indicators, and exploitation of historian-specific
vulnerabilities. Supports OSIsoft PI and Ignition platforms.

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| OT Historian | Database server (OSIsoft PI, Ignition, Wonderware) storing time-series process data from SCADA/DCS systems |
| Pivot Point | Historian's position between IT and OT networks makes it a prime target for attackers to move between zones |
| Data Replay Attack | Feeding historical data to an HMI to mask real-time process manipulation (Stuxnet technique) |
| OSIsoft PI | Most widely deployed OT historian, used by 65% of Global 500 process companies |
| Ignition | Inductive Automation SCADA platform with historian module, increasingly targeted due to Python scripting capabilities |
| CVE-2025-0921 | Ignition SCADA privileged file system vulnerability allowing escalation through malicious project files |
