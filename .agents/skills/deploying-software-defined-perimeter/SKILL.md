# Deploying Software-Defined Perimeter

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of zero trust principles (NIST SP 800-207)
- Knowledge of CSA Software-Defined Perimeter specification
- Familiarity with PKI and mutual TLS authentication
- Experience with network security architecture

## Overview

A Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP) implements zero trust by creating a dynamically provisioned, identity-centric perimeter around individual resources. Defined by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), SDP makes application infrastructure invisible to unauthorized users through a "dark cloud" approach where services are hidden until authenticated and authorized. Unlike traditional VPN, SDP establishes one-to-one encrypted connections between verified users and specific applications.

This skill covers deploying SDP using the CSA v2.0 specification, implementing Single Packet Authorization (SPA), configuring the SDP controller and gateway, and validating the deployment against NIST SP 800-207 requirements.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring deploying software defined perimeter capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with zero trust architecture concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

SPA = Single Packet Authorization
```

### SDP Deployment Models
1. **Client-to-Gateway**: User device connects through SDP gateway to backend applications
2. **Client-to-Server**: Direct connection between user and application server
3. **Server-to-Server**: Workload-to-workload communication through SDP
4. **Gateway-to-Gateway**: Site-to-site connectivity replacing traditional VPN tunnels

## Key Concepts

### Single Packet Authorization (SPA)
SPA is a network security mechanism where the SDP gateway drops all TCP/UDP packets by default. A cryptographically signed single packet must be sent before any connection is established. The gateway validates the SPA packet, and only then opens a temporary port for the authenticated session. This makes the gateway invisible to port scanners.

### Mutual TLS (mTLS)
After SPA validation, both the client and server authenticate each other using X.509 certificates. This bidirectional authentication prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures both endpoints are verified.

### Dynamic Provisioning
SDP connections are provisioned on-demand based on real-time policy evaluation. No persistent network tunnels exist; each session is individually authorized and encrypted.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: SDP Controller Deployment

1. **Deploy SDP Controller**
   - Install SDP controller on hardened, redundant infrastructure
   - Configure PKI integration for certificate issuance
   - Set up authentication backend (LDAP, SAML, OIDC)
   - Configure policy database with application definitions
   - Enable audit logging for all controller decisions

2. **Configure Authentication**
   - Integrate with enterprise IdP via SAML 2.0 or OIDC
   - Configure device certificate enrollment (SCEP/EST)
   - Enable multi-factor authentication requirements
   - Set up certificate revocation checking (OCSP/CRL)

3. **Define Access Policies**
   - Map users/groups to authorized applications
   - Define device posture requirements per application
   - Configure contextual conditions (location, time, risk level)
   - Set session duration and re-authentication intervals

### Phase 2: SDP Gateway Deployment

4. **Deploy Accepting Hosts (Gateways)**
   - Install SDP gateway instances in front of protected applications
   - Configure default-drop firewall rules (deny all inbound)
   - Enable SPA listener on designated ports
   - Configure mTLS with controller-issued certificates
   - Set up health monitoring and failover

5. **Configure Application Definitions**
   - Register each protected application with the controller
   - Define backend server IPs, ports, and protocols
   - Configure load balancing for multi-instance applications
   - Set up application health checks

### Phase 3: Client Deployment

6. **Deploy Initiating Hosts (Clients)**
   - Install SDP client software on user endpoints
   - Enroll device certificates through automated provisioning
   - Configure SPA key material distribution
   - Test authentication flow: SPA → mTLS → application access

7. **Validate End-to-End Flow**
   - Verify SPA packets are accepted by gateway
   - Confirm mTLS handshake succeeds with valid certificates
   - Test application access through the SDP tunnel
   - Verify unauthorized access is blocked (no SPA = invisible gateway)

### Phase 4: Operational Validation

8. **Security Testing**
   - Port scan the SDP gateway to confirm invisibility (all ports show filtered/closed)
   - Attempt connection without valid SPA (must fail silently)
   - Test with revoked client certificate (must be denied)
   - Attempt lateral movement from one authorized app to another unauthorized app
   - Validate audit trail completeness

9. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Configure SIEM integration for SDP controller and gateway logs
   - Set up alerting for failed SPA attempts and certificate errors
   - Establish certificate rotation schedule
   - Document incident response procedures for SDP events
