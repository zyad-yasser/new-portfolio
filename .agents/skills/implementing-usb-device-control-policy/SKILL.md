# Implementing USB Device Control Policy

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Restricting USB storage devices to prevent data exfiltration or malware introduction
- Implementing device control policies via GPO, Intune, or EDR device control modules
- Creating USB whitelists for authorized devices while blocking all others
- Meeting compliance requirements for removable media control (PCI DSS, HIPAA)

**Do not use** for network-based DLP or cloud storage restrictions.

## Prerequisites

- Active Directory GPO or Microsoft Intune for policy deployment
- Device Instance IDs of authorized USB devices
- EDR with device control module (CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint)
- Understanding of USB device classes (mass storage, HID, printer, etc.)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Inventory Current USB Usage

```powershell
# Enumerate currently connected USB devices
Get-PnpDevice -Class USB | Select-Object InstanceId, FriendlyName, Status

# Query USB storage history from registry
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR\*\*" |
  Select-Object FriendlyName, ContainerID, HardwareID

# Collect USB usage across fleet (via EDR or scripts)
# CrowdStrike: Investigate → USB Device Activity
# MDE: DeviceEvents | where ActionType == "UsbDriveMounted"
```

### Step 2: Configure GPO Device Control

```
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → System → Removable Storage Access

- All Removable Storage classes: Deny all access → Enabled
  (Block read AND write for all removable storage)

OR for granular control:
- CD and DVD: Deny read access → Enabled
- Removable Disks: Deny write access → Enabled (read-only USB)
- Tape Drives: Deny all access → Enabled
- WPD Devices: Deny all access → Enabled

To allow specific approved USB devices:
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → System → Device Installation
  → Device Installation Restrictions

- Prevent installation of devices not described by other policy settings → Enabled
- Allow installation of devices that match any of these device IDs → Enabled
  Add approved Device IDs: USB\VID_0781&PID_5583 (example: SanDisk Cruzer)
```

### Step 3: Deploy via Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

```xml
<!-- MDE Device Control policy (XML format) -->
<PolicyGroups>
  <Group Id="{d9a81dc0-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678}"
    Type="Device" Name="Approved USB Devices">
    <MatchClause>
      <MatchType>VID_PID</MatchType>
      <MatchData>0781_5583</MatchData> <!-- SanDisk -->
    </MatchClause>
  </Group>
</PolicyGroups>

<PolicyRules>
  <Rule Id="{rule-guid}" Name="Block unapproved USB storage">
    <IncludedIdList>
      <PrimaryId>RemovableMediaDevices</PrimaryId>
    </IncludedIdList>
    <ExcludedIdList>
      <GroupId>{d9a81dc0-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678}</GroupId>
    </ExcludedIdList>
    <Entry>
      <Type>Deny</Type>
      <AccessMask>63</AccessMask> <!-- All access -->
      <Options>4</Options> <!-- Show notification -->
    </Entry>
  </Rule>
</PolicyRules>
```

### Step 4: Audit and Monitor

```
# Monitor USB events in SIEM:
# Windows Event ID 6416 - New external device recognized
# Windows Event ID 4663 - File access on removable media
# MDE: DeviceEvents where ActionType contains "Usb"

# Generate USB activity reports monthly
# Track: blocked attempts, approved device usage, exception requests
```

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **VID/PID** | Vendor ID and Product ID that uniquely identify USB device models |
| **Device Instance ID** | Unique identifier for a specific physical USB device |
| **Device Control** | EDR/endpoint feature restricting device access based on type, vendor, or serial number |
| **USB Class** | USB device category (mass storage 08h, HID 03h, printer 07h) |

## Tools & Systems

- **Microsoft Defender Device Control**: MDE module for USB restriction policies
- **CrowdStrike Falcon Device Control**: EDR-based USB policy enforcement
- **Group Policy (Removable Storage Access)**: Built-in Windows USB restriction via GPO
- **Endpoint Protector**: Third-party device control and DLP solution

## Common Pitfalls

- **Blocking all USB without exception**: Keyboards and mice are USB HID devices. Block only mass storage class, not all USB.
- **Not communicating policy to users**: USB blocks without user notification generate helpdesk tickets. Display a notification explaining the policy.
- **Ignoring USB-C and Thunderbolt**: Modern devices use USB-C for docking, charging, and storage. Policies must distinguish between USB storage and USB peripherals.
- **No approved device process**: Users with legitimate USB needs (presentations, field data collection) require an exception process with approved, encrypted devices.
