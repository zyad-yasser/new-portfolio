# Performing Mobile Device Forensics with Cellebrite

## When to Use
- When extracting evidence from smartphones or tablets during an investigation
- For recovering deleted messages, call logs, and location data from mobile devices
- During investigations involving communications via messaging apps
- When analyzing mobile application data for evidence of criminal activity
- For corporate investigations involving employee mobile device misuse

## Prerequisites
- Cellebrite UFED Touch/4PC or UFED Physical Analyzer (licensed)
- Alternative open-source tools: ALEAPP, iLEAPP, MEAT, libimobiledevice
- Appropriate cables and adapters for target device
- Faraday bag to isolate the device from network signals
- Legal authorization (warrant, consent, or corporate policy)
- Knowledge of iOS and Android file system structures

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare the Device and Isolation

```bash
# CRITICAL: Immediately place device in airplane mode or Faraday bag
# This prevents remote wipe commands and additional data changes

# Document device state before acquisition
# Record: make, model, IMEI, serial number, OS version, screen lock status
# Photograph the device from all angles

# For Android - Enable USB debugging if accessible
# Settings > Developer Options > USB Debugging > Enable

# For iOS - Trust the forensic workstation
# When prompted on device, tap "Trust This Computer"

# If device is locked, document lock type (PIN, pattern, biometric)
# Cellebrite UFED can bypass certain lock types depending on device model

# Install open-source tools as alternatives
pip install aleapp    # Android Logs Events And Protobuf Parser
pip install ileapp    # iOS Logs Events And Properties Parser
sudo apt-get install libimobiledevice-utils  # iOS acquisition on Linux
```

### Step 2: Perform Device Acquisition

```bash
# === Cellebrite UFED Acquisition ===
# 1. Launch UFED 4PC or connect UFED Touch
# 2. Select Device > Identify device model automatically
# 3. Choose extraction type:
#    - Logical: App data, contacts, messages, call logs (fastest, least data)
#    - File System: Full file system access including databases
#    - Physical: Bit-for-bit image including deleted data (most complete)
#    - Advanced (Checkm8/GrayKey): For locked iOS devices (specific models)
# 4. Select output format and destination
# 5. Begin extraction

# === Open-source iOS acquisition with libimobiledevice ===
# List connected iOS devices
idevice_id -l

# Get device information
ideviceinfo -u <UDID>

# Create iOS backup (logical acquisition)
idevicebackup2 backup --full /cases/case-2024-001/mobile/ios_backup/

# For encrypted backups (contains more data including passwords)
idevicebackup2 backup --full --password /cases/case-2024-001/mobile/ios_backup/

# === Android acquisition with ADB ===
# List connected devices
adb devices

# Full backup (requires screen unlock)
adb backup -apk -shared -all -f /cases/case-2024-001/mobile/android_backup.ab

# Extract specific app data
adb shell pm list packages | grep -i "whatsapp\|telegram\|signal"
adb pull /data/data/com.whatsapp/ /cases/case-2024-001/mobile/whatsapp/

# For rooted Android devices - full filesystem
adb shell "su -c 'dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0 bs=4096'" | \
   dd of=/cases/case-2024-001/mobile/android_physical.dd

# Hash the acquisition
sha256sum /cases/case-2024-001/mobile/*.dd > /cases/case-2024-001/mobile/acquisition_hashes.txt
```

### Step 3: Analyze with ALEAPP (Android) or iLEAPP (iOS)

```bash
# === Android analysis with ALEAPP ===
# ALEAPP processes Android file system extractions
python3 -m aleapp \
   -t fs \
   -i /cases/case-2024-001/mobile/android_extraction/ \
   -o /cases/case-2024-001/analysis/aleapp_report/

# ALEAPP extracts and reports on:
# - Call logs, SMS/MMS messages
# - Chrome browser history and searches
# - WiFi connection history
# - Installed applications
# - Google account activity
# - Location data (Google Maps, Photos)
# - WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal messages
# - App usage statistics
# - Device settings and accounts

# === iOS analysis with iLEAPP ===
python3 -m ileapp \
   -t tar \
   -i /cases/case-2024-001/mobile/ios_backup.tar \
   -o /cases/case-2024-001/analysis/ileapp_report/

# iLEAPP extracts and reports on:
# - iMessage and SMS messages
# - Safari browsing history
# - WiFi and Bluetooth connections
# - Health data and location history
# - App usage (KnowledgeC)
# - Photos with EXIF/GPS data
# - Notes, Calendar, Reminders
# - Keychain data (if decryptable)
# - Screen time data
```

### Step 4: Extract Communications and Messaging Data

```bash
# Extract WhatsApp messages from Android
python3 << 'PYEOF'
import sqlite3
import os

# WhatsApp database location
db_path = "/cases/case-2024-001/mobile/android_extraction/data/data/com.whatsapp/databases/msgstore.db"

if os.path.exists(db_path):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Extract messages
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT
            key_remote_jid AS contact,
            CASE WHEN key_from_me = 1 THEN 'SENT' ELSE 'RECEIVED' END AS direction,
            data AS message_text,
            datetime(timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch') AS msg_time,
            media_mime_type,
            media_size
        FROM messages
        WHERE data IS NOT NULL
        ORDER BY timestamp DESC
        LIMIT 1000
    """)

    with open('/cases/case-2024-001/analysis/whatsapp_messages.csv', 'w') as f:
        f.write("contact,direction,message,timestamp,media_type,media_size\n")
        for row in cursor.fetchall():
            f.write(','.join(str(x) for x in row) + '\n')

    conn.close()
    print("WhatsApp messages extracted successfully")
PYEOF

# Extract iOS iMessage/SMS from sms.db
python3 << 'PYEOF'
import sqlite3

db_path = "/cases/case-2024-001/mobile/ios_extraction/HomeDomain/Library/SMS/sms.db"

conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
cursor = conn.cursor()

cursor.execute("""
    SELECT
        h.id AS phone_number,
        CASE WHEN m.is_from_me = 1 THEN 'SENT' ELSE 'RECEIVED' END AS direction,
        m.text,
        datetime(m.date/1000000000 + 978307200, 'unixepoch') AS msg_time,
        m.service
    FROM message m
    JOIN handle h ON m.handle_id = h.ROWID
    ORDER BY m.date DESC
""")

with open('/cases/case-2024-001/analysis/imessage_sms.csv', 'w') as f:
    f.write("phone,direction,text,timestamp,service\n")
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        f.write(','.join(str(x) for x in row) + '\n')

conn.close()
PYEOF
```

### Step 5: Extract Location Data and Generate Report

```bash
# Extract GPS data from photos
pip install pillow
python3 << 'PYEOF'
from PIL import Image
from PIL.ExifTags import TAGS, GPSTAGS
import os, json

def get_gps(exif_data):
    gps_info = {}
    for key, val in exif_data.items():
        decoded = GPSTAGS.get(key, key)
        gps_info[decoded] = val

    if 'GPSLatitude' in gps_info and 'GPSLongitude' in gps_info:
        lat = gps_info['GPSLatitude']
        lon = gps_info['GPSLongitude']
        lat_val = lat[0] + lat[1]/60 + lat[2]/3600
        lon_val = lon[0] + lon[1]/60 + lon[2]/3600
        if gps_info.get('GPSLatitudeRef') == 'S': lat_val = -lat_val
        if gps_info.get('GPSLongitudeRef') == 'W': lon_val = -lon_val
        return lat_val, lon_val
    return None

locations = []
photo_dir = "/cases/case-2024-001/mobile/ios_extraction/CameraRollDomain/Media/DCIM/"
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(photo_dir):
    for fname in files:
        if fname.lower().endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.heic')):
            try:
                img = Image.open(os.path.join(root, fname))
                exif = img._getexif()
                if exif and 34853 in exif:
                    coords = get_gps(exif[34853])
                    if coords:
                        locations.append({'file': fname, 'lat': coords[0], 'lon': coords[1]})
            except Exception:
                pass

with open('/cases/case-2024-001/analysis/photo_locations.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(locations, f, indent=2)
print(f"Found {len(locations)} geotagged photos")
PYEOF

# Extract location history from Google Location History (Android)
# File: /data/data/com.google.android.gms/databases/lbs.db
# or exported Google Takeout location data
```
