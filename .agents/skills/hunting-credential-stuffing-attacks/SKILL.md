# Hunting Credential Stuffing Attacks


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require hunting credential stuffing attacks
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with security operations concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

Analyze authentication logs to detect credential stuffing by identifying patterns
of distributed login failures, high IP diversity, and suspicious ASN distribution.

```python
import pandas as pd
from collections import Counter

# Load auth logs
df = pd.read_csv("auth_logs.csv", parse_dates=["timestamp"])

# Credential stuffing indicator: many IPs trying few accounts
ip_per_account = df[df["status"] == "failed"].groupby("username")["source_ip"].nunique()
accounts_under_attack = ip_per_account[ip_per_account > 50]
```

Key detection indicators:
1. High unique source IPs per failed username
2. Low success rate across many accounts (< 1%)
3. ASN concentration from cloud/proxy providers
4. Geographic impossibility (same account, distant locations)
5. User-agent uniformity across distributed IPs

## Examples

```python
# Password spray: one password tried across many accounts
spray = df[df["status"] == "failed"].groupby(["source_ip", "password_hash"]).agg(
    accounts=("username", "nunique")).reset_index()
sprays = spray[spray["accounts"] > 10]
```
