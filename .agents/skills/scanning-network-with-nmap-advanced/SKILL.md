# Scanning Network with Nmap Advanced Techniques

## When to Use

- Performing comprehensive asset discovery across large enterprise networks during authorized assessments
- Enumerating service versions and configurations to identify outdated or vulnerable software
- Bypassing firewall rules and IDS during authorized penetration tests using scan evasion techniques
- Scripting automated vulnerability checks using the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
- Generating structured scan output for integration into vulnerability management pipelines

**Do not use** against networks without explicit written authorization, on production systems during peak hours without approval, or to perform denial-of-service through aggressive scan timing.

## Prerequisites

- Nmap 7.90+ installed (`nmap --version` to verify)
- Root/sudo privileges for SYN scans, OS detection, and raw packet techniques
- Written authorization specifying in-scope IP ranges and any excluded hosts
- Network access to target ranges (VPN, direct connection, or jump host)
- Familiarity with TCP/IP protocols and common port assignments

## Workflow

### Step 1: Host Discovery with Multiple Probes

Use layered discovery to find live hosts even when ICMP is blocked:

```bash
# ARP discovery for local subnet (most reliable on LAN)
nmap -sn -PR 192.168.1.0/24 -oA discovery_arp

# Combined ICMP + TCP + UDP probes for remote networks
nmap -sn -PE -PP -PS21,22,25,80,443,445,3389,8080 -PU53,161,500 10.0.0.0/16 -oA discovery_combined

# List scan to resolve DNS names without sending packets to targets
nmap -sL 10.0.0.0/24 -oN dns_resolution.txt
```

Consolidate results into a live hosts file:

```bash
grep "Host:" discovery_combined.gnmap | awk '{print $2}' | sort -t. -k1,1n -k2,2n -k3,3n -k4,4n > live_hosts.txt
```

### Step 2: Port Scanning with Timing and Performance Tuning

```bash
# Full TCP SYN scan with optimized timing
nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 5000 --max-retries 2 -T4 -iL live_hosts.txt -oA full_tcp_scan

# Top 1000 UDP ports with version detection
nmap -sU --top-ports 1000 --version-intensity 0 -T4 -iL live_hosts.txt -oA udp_scan

# Specific port ranges for targeted assessment
nmap -sS -p 1-1024,3306,5432,6379,8080-8090,9200,27017 -iL live_hosts.txt -oA targeted_ports
```

### Step 3: Service Version Detection and OS Fingerprinting

```bash
# Aggressive service detection with version intensity
nmap -sV --version-intensity 5 -sC -O --osscan-guess -p <open_ports> -iL live_hosts.txt -oA service_enum

# Specific service probing for ambiguous ports
nmap -sV --version-all -p 8443 --script ssl-cert,http-title,http-server-header <target> -oN service_detail.txt
```

### Step 4: NSE Vulnerability Scanning

```bash
# Run vulnerability detection scripts
nmap --script vuln -p <open_ports> -iL live_hosts.txt -oA vuln_scan

# Target specific vulnerabilities
nmap --script smb-vuln-ms17-010,smb-vuln-ms08-067 -p 445 -iL live_hosts.txt -oA smb_vulns
nmap --script ssl-heartbleed,ssl-poodle,ssl-ccs-injection -p 443,8443 -iL live_hosts.txt -oA ssl_vulns

# Brute force default credentials on discovered services
nmap --script http-default-accounts,ftp-anon,ssh-auth-methods -p 21,22,80,8080 -iL live_hosts.txt -oA default_creds
```

### Step 5: Firewall Evasion Techniques

```bash
# Fragment packets to evade simple packet inspection
nmap -sS -f --mtu 24 -p 80,443 <target> -oN fragmented_scan.txt

# Use decoy addresses to obscure scan origin
nmap -sS -D RND:10 -p 80,443 <target> -oN decoy_scan.txt

# Spoof source port as DNS (53) to bypass poorly configured firewalls
nmap -sS --source-port 53 -p 1-1024 <target> -oN spoofed_port_scan.txt

# Idle scan using a zombie host (completely stealthy)
nmap -sI <zombie_host> -p 80,443,445 <target> -oN idle_scan.txt

# Slow scan to evade IDS rate-based detection
nmap -sS -T1 --max-rate 10 -p 1-1024 <target> -oA stealth_scan
```

### Step 6: Output Parsing and Reporting

```bash
# Convert XML output to HTML report
xsltproc full_tcp_scan.xml -o scan_report.html

# Extract open ports per host from grepable output
grep "Ports:" full_tcp_scan.gnmap | awk -F'Ports: ' '{print $1 $2}' > open_ports_summary.txt

# Parse XML with nmap-parse-output for structured data
nmap-parse-output full_tcp_scan.xml hosts-to-port 445

# Import into Metasploit database
msfconsole -q -x "db_import full_tcp_scan.xml; hosts; services; exit"

# Generate CSV for vulnerability management tools
nmap-parse-output full_tcp_scan.xml csv > scan_results.csv
```

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **SYN Scan (-sS)** | Half-open TCP scan that sends SYN packets and analyzes responses without completing the three-way handshake, making it faster and stealthier than connect scans |
| **NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)** | Lua-based scripting framework built into Nmap that enables vulnerability detection, brute forcing, service discovery, and custom automation |
| **Timing Templates (-T0 to -T5)** | Predefined scan speed profiles ranging from Paranoid (T0) to Insane (T5), controlling probe parallelism, timeout values, and inter-probe delays |
| **Idle Scan (-sI)** | Advanced scan technique that uses a zombie host's IP ID sequence to port scan a target without sending packets from the scanner's own IP address |
| **Version Intensity** | Controls how many probes Nmap sends to determine service versions, ranging from 0 (light) to 9 (all probes), trading speed for accuracy |
| **Grepable Output (-oG)** | Legacy Nmap output format designed for easy parsing with grep, awk, and sed for scripted analysis of scan results |

## Tools & Systems

- **Nmap 7.90+**: Core scanning engine with NSE scripting, OS detection, version probing, and multiple output formats
- **nmap-parse-output**: Community tool for parsing Nmap XML output into structured formats (CSV, JSON, host lists)
- **Ndiff**: Nmap utility for comparing two scan results to identify changes in network state over time
- **Zenmap**: Official Nmap GUI providing visual network topology mapping and scan profile management
- **Metasploit Framework**: Imports Nmap XML output for direct correlation of scan results with exploit modules

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Enterprise Network Asset Discovery and Vulnerability Baseline

**Context**: A security team needs to establish a vulnerability baseline for a corporate network spanning 10.0.0.0/8 with approximately 5,000 active hosts. Scanning must complete within a weekend maintenance window with minimal network disruption.

**Approach**:
1. Run layered host discovery using ARP (local subnets), TCP SYN (ports 22,80,443,445,3389), and ICMP echo probes across all /24 subnets
2. Perform a full TCP SYN scan on discovered hosts using `--min-rate 5000` and `-T4` to complete within the window
3. Run service version detection and default NSE scripts on all open ports
4. Execute targeted NSE vulnerability scripts for critical services (SMB, SSL/TLS, HTTP)
5. Parse XML output to generate per-subnet CSV reports and import into the vulnerability management platform
6. Schedule Ndiff comparisons against future scans to track remediation progress

**Pitfalls**:
- Setting `--min-rate` too high on congested network segments causing packet loss and false negatives
- Running `-T5` (Insane) timing on production networks, potentially overwhelming older network devices
- Forgetting to scan UDP ports, missing critical services like SNMP (161), DNS (53), and TFTP (69)
- Not saving output in XML format (`-oX` or `-oA`), losing structured data for downstream tool integration

## Output Format

**Scan Duration**: 2h 14m

### Critical Findings

| Host | Port | Service | Version | Vulnerability |
|------|------|---------|---------|---------------|
| 10.10.5.23 | 445/tcp | SMB | Windows Server 2012 R2 | MS17-010 (EternalBlue) |
| 10.10.8.100 | 443/tcp | Apache httpd | 2.4.29 | CVE-2021-41773 (Path Traversal) |
| 10.10.12.5 | 3306/tcp | MySQL | 5.6.24 | CVE-2016-6662 (RCE) |
| 10.10.3.77 | 161/udp | SNMP | v2c | Public community string |

### Recommendations
1. Patch MS17-010 on 10.10.5.23 immediately -- Critical RCE vulnerability
2. Upgrade Apache httpd to 2.4.58+ on 10.10.8.100
3. Upgrade MySQL to 8.0.x on 10.10.12.5 and restrict bind address
4. Change SNMP community strings from "public" on 10.10.3.77
