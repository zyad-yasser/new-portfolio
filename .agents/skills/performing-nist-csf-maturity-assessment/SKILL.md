# Performing NIST CSF Maturity Assessment

## Overview
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, released in February 2024, provides a comprehensive taxonomy for managing cybersecurity risk through six core Functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. This skill covers conducting a maturity assessment against the CSF, using the four Implementation Tiers (Partial, Risk-Informed, Repeatable, Adaptive) to measure organizational cybersecurity posture and create improvement roadmaps.


## When to Use

- When conducting security assessments that involve performing nist csf maturity assessment
- When following incident response procedures for related security events
- When performing scheduled security testing or auditing activities
- When validating security controls through hands-on testing

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of cybersecurity risk management principles
- Access to NIST CSF 2.0 documentation and reference tool
- Knowledge of organizational IT/OT environment and security controls
- Stakeholder access across business units for assessment interviews

## Core Concepts

### CSF 2.0 Functions (6 Functions, 22 Categories)

| Function | Code | Categories | Purpose |
|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Govern** | GV | 6 | Establish and monitor cybersecurity risk management strategy |
| **Identify** | ID | 3 | Determine current cybersecurity risk to the organization |
| **Protect** | PR | 5 | Implement safeguards to prevent or reduce risk |
| **Detect** | DE | 2 | Find and analyze possible cybersecurity attacks |
| **Respond** | RS | 4 | Take action regarding detected cybersecurity incidents |
| **Recover** | RC | 2 | Restore capabilities impaired by cybersecurity incidents |

### Govern Function (New in CSF 2.0)
- GV.OC: Organizational Context
- GV.RM: Risk Management Strategy
- GV.RR: Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities
- GV.PO: Policy
- GV.OV: Oversight
- GV.SC: Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management

### Implementation Tiers
| Tier | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Tier 1 | Partial | Ad hoc, reactive; limited awareness of cybersecurity risk |
| Tier 2 | Risk-Informed | Risk-aware but not organization-wide; approved but may not be policy |
| Tier 3 | Repeatable | Formal policies; consistently implemented; regularly updated |
| Tier 4 | Adaptive | Continuous improvement; real-time risk response; lessons learned integrated |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Scoping and Preparation (Weeks 1-2)
1. Define assessment scope (enterprise-wide vs. business unit)
2. Identify stakeholders and schedule interviews
3. Gather existing documentation (policies, procedures, architecture diagrams)
4. Customize CSF Profile for organizational context
5. Select assessment methodology (self-assessment, facilitated, third-party)

### Phase 2: Current State Assessment (Weeks 3-6)
1. Assess each CSF Category and Subcategory against Implementation Tiers
2. For each subcategory, evaluate:
   - Policy/documentation maturity
   - Implementation completeness
   - Automation level
   - Measurement and metrics
   - Continuous improvement evidence
3. Score using tier criteria (1-4 scale)
4. Document evidence supporting each tier rating
5. Identify strengths, gaps, and improvement areas

### Phase 3: Target State Definition (Weeks 7-8)
1. Define target tier for each Function based on:
   - Risk appetite and tolerance
   - Industry requirements and benchmarks
   - Regulatory obligations
   - Available resources and budget
2. Create Target Profile documenting desired maturity state
3. Validate target state with executive leadership

### Phase 4: Gap Analysis and Roadmap (Weeks 9-12)
1. Compare Current Profile to Target Profile
2. Prioritize gaps based on risk reduction potential
3. Develop improvement roadmap with:
   - Short-term quick wins (0-3 months)
   - Medium-term improvements (3-12 months)
   - Long-term strategic initiatives (12-24 months)
4. Estimate resource requirements for each initiative
5. Assign ownership and timelines

### Phase 5: Implementation and Reassessment (Ongoing)
1. Execute improvement roadmap initiatives
2. Track progress against milestones
3. Conduct periodic reassessments (annually recommended)
4. Report maturity progress to leadership
5. Adjust roadmap based on evolving threats and business changes

## Key Artifacts
- CSF Current Profile (by Function/Category/Subcategory)
- CSF Target Profile
- Gap Analysis Report
- Maturity Assessment Scorecard
- Improvement Roadmap with Priorities
- Executive Summary and Dashboard

## Common Pitfalls
- Assessing technology only without evaluating governance and people
- Setting unrealistic target tiers without resource commitment
- Treating assessment as one-time rather than continuous process
- Ignoring the new Govern function in CSF 2.0
- Not aligning CSF assessment with existing compliance requirements (ISO 27001, SOC 2)
