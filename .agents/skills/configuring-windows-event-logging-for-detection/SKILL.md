# Configuring Windows Event Logging for Detection

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Configuring Windows Advanced Audit Policy for security monitoring
- Enabling process creation auditing with command line logging (Event 4688)
- Setting up logon/logoff auditing for authentication monitoring
- Sizing event log storage and forwarding to SIEM platforms

**Do not use** for Sysmon configuration (separate skill) or Linux audit logging.

## Prerequisites

- Windows Server or Windows 10/11 systems with Group Policy management access
- Active Directory environment with Group Policy Object (GPO) creation privileges
- SIEM platform configured to receive Windows Event Log forwarding
- Understanding of Windows security event IDs and audit categories

## Workflow

### Step 1: Configure Advanced Audit Policy via GPO

```
Computer Configuration → Windows Settings → Security Settings
  → Advanced Audit Policy Configuration → Audit Policies

Recommended settings:
Account Logon:
  - Audit Credential Validation: Success, Failure
  - Audit Kerberos Authentication: Success, Failure

Account Management:
  - Audit Security Group Management: Success
  - Audit User Account Management: Success, Failure

Logon/Logoff:
  - Audit Logon: Success, Failure
  - Audit Logoff: Success
  - Audit Special Logon: Success
  - Audit Other Logon/Logoff Events: Success, Failure

Object Access:
  - Audit File Share: Success, Failure
  - Audit Removable Storage: Success, Failure
  - Audit SAM: Success

Policy Change:
  - Audit Audit Policy Change: Success, Failure
  - Audit Authentication Policy Change: Success

Privilege Use:
  - Audit Sensitive Privilege Use: Success, Failure

Detailed Tracking:
  - Audit Process Creation: Success
  - Audit DPAPI Activity: Success, Failure
```

### Step 2: Enable Command Line in Process Creation Events

```powershell
# Registry: Enable command line logging in Event 4688
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit" `
  -Name ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force

# GPO: Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → System → Audit Process Creation
# "Include command line in process creation events" → Enabled
```

### Step 3: Configure Event Log Sizes

```powershell
# Increase Security log to 1 GB (default 20 MB is insufficient)
wevtutil sl Security /ms:1073741824

# Increase PowerShell Operational log
wevtutil sl "Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational" /ms:536870912

# Set log retention to overwrite as needed
wevtutil sl Security /rt:false

# Configure via GPO:
# Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components
#   → Event Log Service → Security
# Maximum log file size (KB): 1048576
```

### Step 4: Configure Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)

```powershell
# On collector server:
wecutil qc /q

# Create subscription for high-value events:
# Event IDs: 4624 (logon), 4625 (failed logon), 4688 (process create),
# 4672 (special privilege), 4720 (user created), 4728 (group membership),
# 7045 (service installed), 1102 (log cleared)

# On source endpoints (GPO):
# Configure WinRM: winrm quickconfig
# Configure event forwarding: Computer Configuration → Admin Templates
#   → Windows Components → Event Forwarding
# Configure target Subscription Manager: Server=http://collector:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC
```

### Step 5: Key Event IDs for Detection

```
Authentication Events:
  4624 - Successful logon (Type 2=Interactive, 3=Network, 10=RemoteInteractive)
  4625 - Failed logon attempt
  4648 - Logon using explicit credentials (RunAs, pass-the-hash indicator)
  4672 - Special privileges assigned (admin logon)
  4776 - NTLM credential validation

Process Events:
  4688 - Process creation (with command line if enabled)
  4689 - Process termination

Account Events:
  4720 - User account created
  4722 - User account enabled
  4724 - Password reset attempted
  4728 - Member added to security group
  4732 - Member added to local group
  4756 - Member added to universal group

Service/System Events:
  7045 - New service installed (persistence indicator)
  1102 - Audit log cleared (evidence tampering)
  4697 - Service installed in the system

Lateral Movement Indicators:
  4648 + 4624(Type 3) - Credential-based lateral movement
  5140 - Network share accessed
  5145 - Network share access check (detailed file share)
```

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Advanced Audit Policy** | Granular audit subcategories (58 subcategories vs. 9 basic categories) |
| **Event ID 4688** | Process creation event; essential for tracking execution on endpoints |
| **WEF** | Windows Event Forwarding; centralized log collection without third-party agents |
| **Logon Type** | Numeric code indicating authentication method (2=interactive, 3=network, 10=RDP) |

## Tools & Systems

- **Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)**: Built-in centralized log collection
- **NXLog**: Open-source log forwarding agent for Windows events
- **Winlogbeat**: Elastic Agent for shipping Windows event logs to Elasticsearch
- **Palantir WEF Configuration**: Open-source WEF subscription templates

## Common Pitfalls

- **Using basic audit policy instead of advanced**: Basic and advanced audit policies conflict. Always use advanced audit policy exclusively.
- **Default log size too small**: 20 MB Security log fills in minutes on busy servers. Set minimum 1 GB.
- **Missing command line logging**: Event 4688 without command line content has minimal detection value. Always enable ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled.
- **Not forwarding logs**: Local event logs are lost when endpoints are wiped by ransomware. Forward to centralized SIEM immediately.
