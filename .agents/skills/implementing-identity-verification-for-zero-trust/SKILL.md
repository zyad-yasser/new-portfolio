# Implementing Identity Verification for Zero Trust

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of zero trust principles (NIST SP 800-207)
- Familiarity with identity providers (Azure AD, Okta, Ping Identity)
- Knowledge of authentication protocols (SAML 2.0, OIDC, FIDO2)
- Understanding of MFA and passwordless authentication

## Overview

Identity is the foundational pillar of zero trust architecture. NIST SP 800-207 mandates that all resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed. Identity verification in zero trust goes beyond traditional username/password by implementing continuous, risk-adaptive authentication using multiple signals including device posture, behavioral biometrics, location, and network context.

This skill covers implementing phishing-resistant MFA, continuous identity verification, risk-based conditional access, and identity governance aligned with the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model Identity Pillar.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing identity verification for zero trust capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with zero trust architecture concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

### Identity Provider Architecture

1. **Primary IdP**: Azure AD / Okta / Ping Identity for centralized identity management
2. **FIDO2 Authenticators**: Hardware security keys (YubiKey) or platform authenticators (Windows Hello, Touch ID)
3. **Risk Engine**: Adaptive access using identity threat detection (Microsoft Entra ID Protection, Okta ThreatInsight)
4. **Identity Governance**: Lifecycle management, access reviews, just-in-time provisioning
5. **Privileged Identity**: Separate verification for elevated access (CyberArk, BeyondTrust)

## Key Concepts

### Phishing-Resistant MFA
FIDO2/WebAuthn eliminates phishable credentials by binding authentication to the origin domain. Hardware security keys and platform authenticators provide cryptographic proof of identity without transmitting secrets.

### Continuous Identity Verification
Rather than authenticating once at session start, zero trust requires ongoing verification through session token evaluation, behavioral analytics, and periodic re-authentication challenges based on risk signals.

### Risk-Based Conditional Access
Conditional access policies evaluate multiple signals (user risk level, sign-in risk, device compliance, location) to dynamically adjust authentication requirements and access grants.

### Identity Threat Detection
AI-driven analytics detect compromised identities through impossible travel detection, anomalous sign-in patterns, credential stuffing detection, and token replay attacks.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identity Infrastructure

1. **Consolidate Identity Providers**
   - Audit all identity sources across the organization
   - Federate to a single authoritative IdP using SAML 2.0 or OIDC
   - Configure SCIM for automated provisioning and deprovisioning
   - Eliminate local accounts and shared credentials

2. **Deploy Phishing-Resistant MFA**
   - Enroll all users in FIDO2/WebAuthn with hardware security keys
   - Configure platform authenticators (Windows Hello for Business, macOS Touch ID)
   - Disable SMS and voice call as MFA methods (phishable)
   - Create conditional access policy requiring phishing-resistant methods for all sign-ins

3. **Configure Conditional Access Policies**
   - Require compliant device for access to sensitive applications
   - Block legacy authentication protocols (basic auth, IMAP, POP3)
   - Require MFA for all users from untrusted locations
   - Enforce session time limits with re-authentication
   - Block or require additional verification for high-risk sign-ins

### Phase 2: Risk-Based Authentication

4. **Enable Identity Threat Detection**
   - Activate Microsoft Entra ID Protection or Okta ThreatInsight
   - Configure risk levels: low (allow), medium (require MFA), high (block and investigate)
   - Enable impossible travel detection and anomalous token alerts
   - Integrate identity risk signals with SIEM/SOAR

5. **Implement Step-Up Authentication**
   - For sensitive operations (privilege elevation, financial transactions), require additional verification
   - Configure step-up policies: re-authenticate with hardware key
   - Integrate with PAM for privileged session approval workflows
   - Log all step-up events for audit trail

### Phase 3: Continuous Verification

6. **Deploy Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)**
   - Enable Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol (CAEP) for real-time token revocation
   - Configure critical event triggers: user disabled, password changed, location change
   - Test that token revocation occurs within minutes (not hours) of security event
   - Monitor CAE event logs for operational health

7. **Implement Session Controls**
   - Configure session duration limits based on application sensitivity
   - Enable sign-in frequency controls (re-authenticate every N hours)
   - Implement persistent browser session controls
   - Configure app-enforced restrictions for unmanaged devices

### Phase 4: Identity Governance

8. **Automate Identity Lifecycle**
   - Configure joiner-mover-leaver workflows with HR system integration
   - Automate access provisioning based on role and department
   - Enable just-in-time access for temporary elevated permissions
   - Configure automatic access expiration for contractors and guests

9. **Implement Access Reviews**
   - Schedule quarterly access certification campaigns
   - Configure automated reminders and escalation
   - Require manager approval for continued access
   - Auto-revoke access for unreviewed certifications
