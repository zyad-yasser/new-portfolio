# Performing SCADA HMI Security Assessment

## When to Use

- When assessing the security posture of HMI systems in SCADA/DCS environments
- When evaluating web-based HMI interfaces for common web vulnerabilities
- When auditing HMI authentication, authorization, and session management
- When testing communication security between HMIs and PLCs/RTUs
- When preparing for IEC 62443 or NERC CIP compliance assessments

**Do not use** for testing HMIs in active production without a maintenance window and rollback plan, for PLC-level protocol analysis (see performing-s7comm-protocol-security-analysis), or for general web application testing on non-OT systems.

## Prerequisites

- HMI system inventory with vendor, version, and network configuration details
- Lab or test environment mirroring production HMI setup (preferred for active testing)
- Authorization from plant operations for testing during maintenance windows
- NIST SP 800-82 and IEC 62443 security requirements documentation
- Network capture capability on HMI-to-PLC communication segment

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess HMI Attack Surface

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| HMI | Human-Machine Interface providing operators visual representation and control of industrial processes |
| Web HMI | Browser-based HMI interface accessible via HTTP/HTTPS, subject to standard web vulnerabilities |
| Setpoint | Target value for a process variable that operators can change through the HMI; unauthorized changes can cause process upset |
| Alarm Suppression | Attacker technique of disabling or hiding HMI alarms to mask malicious process manipulation |
| WinCC | Siemens SCADA/HMI software widely deployed in manufacturing and process industries |
| CVE-2025-0921 | Ignition SCADA privileged file system vulnerability exploitable through malicious project uploads |
