# Scanning Containers with Trivy in CI/CD

## When to Use

- When building Docker container images in CI/CD and needing automated vulnerability scanning before registry push
- When establishing quality gates that prevent images with critical or high CVEs from reaching production
- When compliance requirements mandate vulnerability scanning of all container images before deployment
- When scanning IaC files (Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests) alongside container image scanning
- When needing a single tool to scan OS packages, language-specific dependencies, and misconfigurations

**Do not use** for runtime container security monitoring (use Falco), for scanning running containers in production (use runtime agents), or when only scanning application source code without containerization (use SAST tools).

## Prerequisites

- Trivy CLI installed (v0.50+) or access to aquasecurity/trivy-action GitHub Action
- Docker daemon available in CI/CD for building and scanning images
- Container registry credentials for pulling base images and pushing scanned images
- Trivy vulnerability database accessible (downloaded automatically or cached)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Configure Trivy Scanning in GitHub Actions

Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that builds a Docker image and scans it with Trivy before pushing to a container registry.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/container-security.yml
name: Container Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'Dockerfile'
      - 'docker-compose*.yml'
      - 'src/**'
      - 'requirements*.txt'
      - 'package*.json'

jobs:
  build-and-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      contents: read

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t app:${{ github.sha }} .

      - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.28.0
        with:
          image-ref: 'app:${{ github.sha }}'
          format: 'sarif'
          output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
          severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
          exit-code: '1'
          ignore-unfixed: true

      - name: Upload Trivy scan results
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
          category: 'trivy-container'

      - name: Run Trivy misconfiguration scanner
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.28.0
        with:
          scan-type: 'config'
          scan-ref: '.'
          format: 'table'
          exit-code: '1'
          severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
```

### Step 2: Scan Dockerfiles for Misconfigurations

Trivy detects common Dockerfile security issues such as running as root, using latest tags, and exposing unnecessary ports.

```bash
# Scan Dockerfile for misconfigurations
trivy config --severity HIGH,CRITICAL ./Dockerfile

# Scan with custom policy directory
trivy config --policy ./security-policies --severity MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL .

# Example secure Dockerfile practices Trivy checks for:
# - USER instruction present (not running as root)
# - HEALTHCHECK instruction defined
# - Base image uses specific tag, not :latest
# - No secrets in ENV or ARG instructions
# - COPY preferred over ADD
```

### Step 3: Integrate with GitLab CI/CD

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - build
  - scan
  - push

variables:
  TRIVY_CACHE_DIR: .trivycache/

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
    - docker save $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA -o image.tar
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - image.tar

trivy-scan:
  stage: scan
  image:
    name: aquasec/trivy:latest
    entrypoint: [""]
  cache:
    paths:
      - .trivycache/
  script:
    - trivy image
        --input image.tar
        --exit-code 1
        --severity CRITICAL,HIGH
        --ignore-unfixed
        --format json
        --output trivy-report.json
    - trivy image
        --input image.tar
        --severity CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM
        --format table
  artifacts:
    reports:
      container_scanning: trivy-report.json
    paths:
      - trivy-report.json
  allow_failure: false

push:
  stage: push
  needs: [trivy-scan]
  script:
    - docker load -i image.tar
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
```

### Step 4: Configure Trivy Ignore and Exception Handling

Manage false positives and accepted risks through Trivy's ignore file and VEX statements.

```yaml
# .trivyignore.yaml
vulnerabilities:
  - id: CVE-2023-44487    # HTTP/2 rapid reset - mitigated at load balancer
    statement: "Mitigated by WAF rate limiting at ingress layer"
    expires: 2026-06-01

  - id: CVE-2024-21626    # runc container escape - patched in base image update
    statement: "Tracked in JIRA-SEC-1234, base image update scheduled"
    expires: 2026-03-15

misconfigurations:
  - id: DS002             # User not set - required for init containers
    paths:
      - "docker/init-container/Dockerfile"
    statement: "Init container requires root for volume permission setup"
```

### Step 5: Implement Database Caching and Offline Scanning

Cache the Trivy vulnerability database in CI/CD to reduce scan times and enable air-gapped environments.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions with database caching
- name: Cache Trivy DB
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: /tmp/trivy-db
    key: trivy-db-${{ hashFiles('.github/workflows/container-security.yml') }}
    restore-keys: trivy-db-

- name: Run Trivy with cached DB
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.28.0
  with:
    image-ref: 'app:${{ github.sha }}'
    cache-dir: /tmp/trivy-db
    format: 'json'
    output: 'trivy-results.json'
    severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
    exit-code: '1'
```

```bash
# Air-gapped: Download DB manually and mount
trivy image --download-db-only --cache-dir /path/to/cache
# Transfer cache to air-gapped system
trivy image --skip-db-update --cache-dir /path/to/cache myimage:tag
```

### Step 6: Generate SBOM and Scan for License Compliance

Use Trivy to generate Software Bill of Materials alongside vulnerability scanning.

```bash
# Generate SBOM in CycloneDX format
trivy image --format cyclonedx --output sbom.cdx.json app:latest

# Generate SBOM in SPDX format
trivy image --format spdx-json --output sbom.spdx.json app:latest

# Scan SBOM for vulnerabilities (decouple generation from scanning)
trivy sbom sbom.cdx.json --severity CRITICAL,HIGH

# Scan with license detection
trivy image --scanners vuln,license --severity HIGH,CRITICAL app:latest
```

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| CVE | Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures — standardized identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities |
| Vulnerability DB | Trivy's regularly updated database aggregating CVE data from NVD, vendor advisories, and language-specific sources |
| Misconfiguration | Security-relevant configuration issue in Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, or IaC templates |
| SBOM | Software Bill of Materials — complete inventory of all components and dependencies in a container image |
| Ignore Unfixed | Flag to skip CVEs without available patches, reducing noise from vulnerabilities with no actionable fix |
| VEX | Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange — machine-readable statements about whether a vulnerability is exploitable in context |
| Exit Code | Non-zero return code from Trivy when findings exceed the severity threshold, used to fail CI/CD pipelines |

## Tools & Systems

- **Trivy**: Open-source vulnerability scanner by Aqua Security supporting images, filesystems, repos, and IaC
- **trivy-action**: Official GitHub Action for running Trivy scans in GitHub Actions workflows
- **Trivy Operator**: Kubernetes operator that continuously scans cluster workloads with Trivy
- **Grype**: Alternative image scanner by Anchore for comparison and validation of scan results
- **Harbor**: Container registry with built-in Trivy integration for automatic image scanning on push

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Multi-Stage Build with Separate Scan and Push

**Context**: A team builds multi-stage Docker images and needs to scan the final production image before pushing to ECR, while also scanning the build stage for supply chain risks.

**Approach**:
1. Build the Docker image with `--target production` for the final stage
2. Run Trivy with `--severity CRITICAL,HIGH --exit-code 1 --ignore-unfixed` to block on exploitable issues
3. Generate an SBOM in CycloneDX format and store as a build artifact
4. Upload SARIF results to GitHub Security tab for visibility
5. Only push to ECR if the Trivy scan exits with code 0
6. Tag the pushed image with the scan timestamp and Trivy DB version for audit traceability

**Pitfalls**: Scanning only the final stage misses vulnerable packages that were present in build stages and may have influenced the build. Run `trivy fs` on the build context separately. Caching the Trivy DB too aggressively (weekly) means newly published CVEs take days to appear in scans.
