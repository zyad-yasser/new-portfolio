# Implementing Network Deception with Honeypots

## When to Use

- When deploying deception technology to detect lateral movement
- To create early warning indicators for network intrusion
- During security architecture design to add detection depth
- When monitoring for unauthorized internal scanning or credential theft
- To gather threat intelligence on attacker techniques and tools

## Prerequisites

- Linux server or VM for honeypot deployment (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended)
- Python 3.8+ with pip for OpenCanary installation
- Docker for T-Pot or containerized deployment
- Network segment with appropriate VLAN configuration
- SIEM integration for alert forwarding (syslog, webhook, or file-based)
- Firewall rules allowing inbound connections to honeypot services

## Workflow

1. **Plan Deployment**: Select honeypot types and network placement strategy.
2. **Install Honeypot**: Deploy OpenCanary, Cowrie, or T-Pot on dedicated host.
3. **Configure Services**: Enable emulated services (SSH, HTTP, SMB, FTP, RDP).
4. **Set Up Alerting**: Configure log forwarding to SIEM and alert channels.
5. **Deploy Canary Tokens**: Place credential files, shares, and DNS entries.
6. **Monitor Interactions**: Analyze honeypot logs for attacker activity.
7. **Tune and Maintain**: Update configurations based on detection results.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| OpenCanary | Lightweight Python honeypot with modular service emulation |
| Cowrie | Medium-interaction SSH/Telnet honeypot capturing commands |
| T-Pot | Multi-honeypot platform with ELK stack visualization |
| Canary Token | Tripwire credential or file that alerts when accessed |
| Low-Interaction | Emulates services at protocol level without full OS |
| High-Interaction | Full OS honeypot capturing complete attacker sessions |

## Tools & Systems

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| OpenCanary | Modular honeypot daemon with service emulation |
| Cowrie | SSH/Telnet honeypot with session recording |
| T-Pot | All-in-one multi-honeypot platform |
| Dionaea | Malware-capturing honeypot for exploit detection |
| Splunk/Elastic | SIEM for honeypot alert aggregation |
