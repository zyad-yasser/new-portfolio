# Performing Brand Monitoring for Impersonation

## Overview

Brand impersonation attacks exploit consumer trust through lookalike domains, fake social media profiles, counterfeit mobile apps, and phishing sites that mimic legitimate brands. In 2025, brand impersonation remained one of the most costly cyber threats, with AI-generated phishing emails achieving a 54% click-through rate. This skill covers building a comprehensive brand monitoring program that detects domain squatting, social media impersonation, fake mobile apps, unauthorized logo usage, and dark web brand mentions using automated scanning and alerting.


## When to Use

- When conducting security assessments that involve performing brand monitoring for impersonation
- When following incident response procedures for related security events
- When performing scheduled security testing or auditing activities
- When validating security controls through hands-on testing

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ with `dnstwist`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `Levenshtein`, `tweepy` libraries
- API keys: VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing, Twitter/X API, Shodan
- List of brand assets: domains, trademarks, logos, executive names
- Certificate Transparency monitoring (Certstream or crt.sh)
- Understanding of domain registration and TLD landscape

## Key Concepts

### Attack Surface

Brand impersonation spans multiple channels: domain squatting (typosquatting, homoglyphs, TLD variations), phishing sites (cloned websites with stolen branding), social media (fake profiles impersonating executives or company), mobile apps (counterfeit apps in app stores), email spoofing (display name and domain impersonation), and dark web (brand mentions in forums, marketplaces).

### Detection Approaches

Effective brand monitoring combines proactive scanning (domain permutation with dnstwist, CT log monitoring), web crawling (screenshot comparison, logo detection), social media monitoring (profile name matching, post content analysis), app store monitoring (name and icon similarity detection), and dark web monitoring (forum scraping, marketplace tracking).

### Risk Prioritization

Not all impersonation is malicious. Risk factors include: active web content (especially login pages), SSL certificate present, MX records configured (email receiving capability), visual similarity to legitimate site, recent registration date, and hosting in regions associated with cybercrime.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Multi-Channel Brand Monitoring System

```python

### Step 2: Takedown Request Generation

Dear Abuse Team,

We are writing to report a domain that is impersonating {brand_info['name']}
for apparent phishing/fraud purposes.

Infringing Domain: {finding.get('indicator', '')}
IP Address: {', '.join(finding.get('dns_a', ['Unknown']))}
Detection Method: {finding.get('fuzzer', 'domain similarity analysis')}
Web Similarity Score: {finding.get('ssdeep_score', 'N/A')}%
Detection Date: {finding.get('detected_at', '')}

Our legitimate domain(s): {', '.join(brand_info['domains'])}

This domain appears to be impersonating our brand through {finding.get('fuzzer', 'typosquatting')}.
We request immediate suspension of this domain.

Evidence of infringement is available upon request.

Regards,
{brand_info['name']} Security Team
"""
    return request
```

## Validation Criteria

- Domain squatting detected through dnstwist permutation scanning
- Google Safe Browsing checks identify known threats
- Certificate transparency monitoring detects new phishing certificates
- Social media monitoring identifies impersonation profiles
- App store monitoring detects counterfeit applications
- Takedown requests generated with required evidence
