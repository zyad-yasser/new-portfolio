# Detecting Stuxnet-Style Attacks

## When to Use

- When implementing advanced threat detection for high-value OT targets (nuclear, chemical, critical infrastructure)
- When building detection for APT-style attacks targeting PLC logic and process manipulation
- When establishing PLC logic integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications
- When investigating suspected process anomalies that may indicate cyber-physical attacks
- When designing defense-in-depth strategies against nation-state level OT threats

**Do not use** for basic OT intrusion detection (see detecting-attacks-on-scada-systems), for malware analysis of Stuxnet samples (see malware reverse engineering skills), or for PLC programming and logic development.

## Prerequisites

- Detailed understanding of the Stuxnet attack chain and MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework
- PLC logic backup repository with known-good baseline copies of all PLC programs
- Engineering workstation monitoring (EDR with OT awareness)
- Physics-based process models for the controlled physical process
- Network monitoring for industrial protocol traffic analysis
