# Performing Oil & Gas Cybersecurity Assessment

## When to Use

- When conducting a cybersecurity assessment of a refinery, pipeline, or production facility
- When preparing for TSA Pipeline Security Directive compliance (SD-01, SD-02)
- When assessing cybersecurity posture against API Standard 1164 (Pipeline SCADA Security)
- When evaluating the security of remote wellhead SCADA systems and satellite communications
- When a merger, acquisition, or regulatory audit requires a comprehensive OT security evaluation

**Do not use** for IT-only corporate network assessments of oil and gas companies, for physical security assessments without a cyber component, or for environmental compliance assessments.

## Prerequisites

- Written authorization from facility management and operations team
- Understanding of oil and gas operations (upstream, midstream, downstream processes)
- Familiarity with API 1164, TSA SD-01/SD-02, IEC 62443, and NIST CSF
- Passive monitoring tools for OT network traffic capture
- Access to network diagrams, SCADA architecture documentation, and safety studies (HAZOP)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scope Assessment Based on Facility Type

Oil and gas facilities have unique characteristics based on their operational segment that affect the assessment approach.

### Step 2: Assess Pipeline SCADA Security

Pipeline SCADA systems have unique challenges including long-distance communications over untrusted media, unmanned remote sites, and custody transfer integrity requirements.
