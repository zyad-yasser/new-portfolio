# Implementing Digital Signatures with Ed25519

## Overview

Ed25519 is a high-performance digital signature algorithm using the Edwards curve Curve25519. It provides 128-bit security with 64-byte signatures and 32-byte keys, offering significant advantages over RSA and ECDSA including deterministic signatures (no random nonce needed), resistance to side-channel attacks, and fast verification. This skill covers implementing Ed25519 for document signing, code signing, and API authentication.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing digital signatures with ed25519 capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with cryptography concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Objectives

- Generate Ed25519 key pairs for signing
- Sign messages and files with Ed25519
- Verify signatures against public keys
- Implement multi-signature verification
- Build a simple code signing system
- Compare Ed25519 performance with RSA and ECDSA

## Key Concepts

### Ed25519 vs RSA vs ECDSA

| Property | Ed25519 | RSA-3072 | ECDSA P-256 |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Security | 128-bit | 128-bit | 128-bit |
| Public key size | 32 bytes | 384 bytes | 64 bytes |
| Signature size | 64 bytes | 384 bytes | 64 bytes |
| Key generation | ~50 us | ~100 ms | ~1 ms |
| Sign | ~70 us | ~5 ms | ~200 us |
| Verify | ~200 us | ~200 us | ~500 us |
| Deterministic | Yes | No (PSS) | No (unless RFC 6979) |

### Key Properties

- **Deterministic**: Same message + key always produces same signature
- **Collision-resistant**: No separate hash function needed
- **Side-channel resistant**: Constant-time implementation
- **Small keys**: 32 bytes each (public and private)

## Security Considerations

- Ed25519 does not support key recovery from signatures
- Verify the full message, not a hash (Ed25519 hashes internally)
- Public keys must be validated before use (check for low-order points)
- Private keys should be stored encrypted at rest
- Ed25519 is not yet approved for all NIST use cases (Ed448 is preferred for federal)

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Key pair generation produces valid Ed25519 keys
- [ ] Signature verification succeeds for valid message
- [ ] Signature verification fails for tampered message
- [ ] Signature verification fails for wrong public key
- [ ] Deterministic: same input produces same signature
- [ ] File signing and verification works correctly
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds RSA-3072
