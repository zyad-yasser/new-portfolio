# Performing Privileged Account Access Review

## Overview

Privileged Account Access Review is a critical identity governance process that validates whether users with elevated permissions still require their access. This review covers domain admins, service accounts, database administrators, cloud IAM roles, and application-level privileged accounts. Regular access reviews are mandated by SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOX compliance frameworks, typically required quarterly for high-privilege accounts.


## When to Use

- When conducting security assessments that involve performing privileged account access review
- When following incident response procedures for related security events
- When performing scheduled security testing or auditing activities
- When validating security controls through hands-on testing

## Prerequisites

- PAM solution deployed (CyberArk, BeyondTrust, Delinea, or equivalent)
- Identity governance platform (SailPoint, Saviynt, or equivalent)
- Complete inventory of privileged accounts across all platforms
- Defined access review policy with SLAs and escalation procedures
- Designated reviewers (account owners, managers, security team)

## Core Concepts

### Privileged Account Categories

| Category | Examples | Risk Level | Review Frequency |
|----------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Domain Admins | Enterprise Admin, Domain Admin, Schema Admin | Critical | Monthly |
| Service Accounts | SQL service, backup agents, monitoring agents | High | Quarterly |
| Cloud IAM | AWS root, Azure Global Admin, GCP Owner | Critical | Monthly |
| Database Admin | DBA accounts, sa/sys accounts | High | Quarterly |
| Application Admin | App admin roles, API keys with admin scope | Medium | Semi-annually |
| Emergency/Break-glass | Firecall accounts, emergency access | Critical | After each use |

### Four-Pillar Review Framework

```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Account Discovery and Inventory

Enumerate all privileged accounts across the environment:

**Active Directory:**
- Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, Schema Admins groups
- Accounts with AdminCount=1 attribute
- Service accounts with SPN (Service Principal Names)
- Accounts with delegation rights (Unconstrained/Constrained)

**Cloud Platforms:**
- AWS: IAM users/roles with AdministratorAccess, PowerUserAccess, or `iam:*` permissions
- Azure: Global Administrator, Privileged Role Administrator, Security Administrator roles
- GCP: Owner, Editor roles at organization/project level

**Databases:**
- SQL Server: sysadmin, db_owner, securityadmin fixed roles
- Oracle: DBA, SYSDBA, SYSOPER privileges
- PostgreSQL: superuser, createrole, createdb attributes

### Step 2: Establish Review Criteria

Each privileged account must be evaluated against:

1. **Business Justification**: Does the user's current role require this privilege?
2. **Least Privilege**: Can the task be performed with lower privileges?
3. **Account Activity**: Has the account been active in the last 90 days?
4. **Compliance Status**: Does the account meet password policy, MFA requirements?
5. **Separation of Duties**: Does the access create SoD conflicts?
6. **Ownership**: Is a responsible owner assigned and active?

### Step 3: Conduct the Review

For each account, the designated reviewer must:

1. Review the account details, permissions, and last activity date
2. Approve (certify) the access if still required with documented justification
3. Revoke access if no longer needed or the reviewer cannot justify the privilege
4. Flag for investigation if anomalous activity or policy violations are detected
5. Escalate if the reviewer cannot make a determination

Decision matrix:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Active user, justified privilege | Certify - maintain access |
| Active user, excessive privilege | Remediate - reduce to least privilege |
| Inactive > 90 days | Disable account, notify owner |
| No owner identified | Disable account, escalate to security |
| SoD conflict detected | Remediate - reassign or add compensating controls |
| Break-glass account | Verify last use was authorized, reset credentials |

### Step 4: Remediation and Enforcement

After reviews are completed:

- Revoke access for accounts that were not certified within the SLA period
- Implement automatic revocation for accounts not reviewed within 14 days
- Rotate credentials for all certified privileged accounts
- Convert standing privileges to just-in-time (JIT) access where possible
- Update PAM vault with current account inventory

### Step 5: Reporting and Documentation

Generate review reports including:

- Total accounts reviewed vs. total in scope
- Certification rate (approved vs. revoked)
- Average review completion time
- Overdue reviews and escalations
- Remediation actions taken
- Comparison with previous review cycle
