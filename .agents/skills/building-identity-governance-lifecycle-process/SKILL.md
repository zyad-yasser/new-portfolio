# Building Identity Governance Lifecycle Process

## When to Use

- Organization lacks automated joiner-mover-leaver (JML) processes for identity management
- Access provisioning is manual and takes days, creating productivity loss and security gaps
- Former employees retain access to systems after termination (orphaned accounts)
- Role explosion has created thousands of roles with unclear ownership and overlapping entitlements
- Compliance requirements mandate documented identity lifecycle processes (SOX, HIPAA, GDPR)
- No centralized visibility into who has access to what across the enterprise

**Do not use** for single-application user management; identity governance addresses cross-system lifecycle management requiring correlation of authoritative HR sources with downstream application provisioning.

## Prerequisites

- Authoritative HR system (Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, BambooHR) as identity source of truth
- IGA platform (SailPoint, Saviynt, One Identity) or Microsoft Entra ID Governance
- Active Directory and/or Azure AD as primary directory services
- Application connectors for target systems requiring automated provisioning
- Defined organizational role structure and reporting hierarchy
- Stakeholder buy-in from HR, IT, security, and business unit managers

## Workflow

Map the identity lifecycle from hire to termination:

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML)** | Core identity lifecycle transitions covering employee onboarding (joiner), role/department changes (mover), and offboarding (leaver) |
| **Birthright Access** | Baseline entitlements automatically provisioned based on job code, department, or location without requiring an access request |
| **Role Mining** | Analysis of existing access patterns to derive role definitions by identifying common entitlement groupings across similar job functions |
| **Orphaned Account** | Application account that no longer has a corresponding active identity in the authoritative HR source, representing a security risk |
| **Authoritative Source** | System of record (typically HR) that serves as the single source of truth for identity attributes and employment status |
| **Access Request Workflow** | Self-service process enabling users to request additional entitlements with risk-based approval routing |

## Tools & Systems

- **SailPoint IdentityIQ/IdentityNow**: Enterprise IGA platform for lifecycle management, access certifications, and automated provisioning
- **Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud**: Cloud-native IGA with identity warehouse, access governance, and application access management
- **Microsoft Entra ID Governance**: Identity governance capabilities including lifecycle workflows, access reviews, and entitlement management
- **One Identity Manager**: IGA solution with business role management, attestation, and IT shop for access requests

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Building JML Process for 10,000-Employee Organization

**Context**: Rapidly growing company has no automated identity lifecycle. IT manually creates accounts, taking 3-5 days for new hires. Terminated employees retain access for weeks. Audit found 2,300 orphaned accounts across 45 applications.

**Approach**:
1. Integrate Workday as authoritative source with daily delta sync to IGA platform
2. Mine existing access patterns to define birthright roles for the top 20 job codes (covering 80% of employees)
3. Implement pre-hire provisioning triggered 7 days before start date for AD, email, and birthright apps
4. Build termination workflow that disables all access within 1 hour of HR status change
5. Create mover workflow that recalculates roles when job code or department changes
6. Deploy self-service access request portal with risk-based approval chains
7. Run orphaned account detection to identify and remediate the 2,300 existing orphans
8. Schedule quarterly access certifications to prevent access accumulation

**Pitfalls**:
- Not defining a single authoritative source leads to conflicting identity data from multiple HR systems
- Mining roles without business validation creates technical roles that do not align with organizational structure
- Automating termination without grace period for knowledge transfer frustrates business managers
- Not handling contractor and vendor identities that exist outside the HR system
