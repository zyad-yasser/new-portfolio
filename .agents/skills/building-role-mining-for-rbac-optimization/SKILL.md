# Building Role Mining for RBAC Optimization

## Overview

Role mining is the process of analyzing existing user-permission assignments to discover optimal roles for a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. Organizations accumulate excessive permissions over time through job changes, project assignments, and ad-hoc access grants, leading to "role explosion" where thousands of granular roles exist with significant overlap. Role mining uses data analysis -- including clustering algorithms, formal concept analysis, and graph-based methods -- to consolidate permissions into a minimal set of roles that accurately represent business functions while enforcing least privilege.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring building role mining for rbac optimization capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Export of current user-permission assignments (CSV/database)
- Identity governance platform or directory service access
- Python 3.9+ with pandas, scikit-learn, numpy
- Understanding of organizational structure and job functions
- Stakeholder access for role validation workshops

## Core Concepts

### Role Mining Approaches

| Approach | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Bottom-Up | Analyze existing permissions to discover common patterns | Large datasets with organic permission growth |
| Top-Down | Design roles from business requirements and job descriptions | Greenfield RBAC or organizational restructuring |
| Hybrid | Combine bottom-up analysis with top-down business validation | Most production environments |

### Role Mining Algorithms

**1. Permission Clustering**: Group users with similar permission sets using k-means or hierarchical clustering. Users in the same cluster share a common role.

**2. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)**: Mathematical framework that identifies complete set of concepts (user groups sharing exact permission sets) from a binary user-permission matrix.

**3. Graph-Based Mining**: Model users and permissions as a bipartite graph, then find dense subgraphs representing candidate roles.

**4. Boolean Matrix Decomposition**: Decompose the user-permission matrix U into U ≈ R × P where R maps users to roles and P maps roles to permissions.

### Role Mining Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Role Count | Total distinct roles after mining | Minimize |
| Coverage | Permissions explained by mined roles / Total permissions | > 95% |
| Weighted Structural Complexity (WSC) | Sum of role-user + role-permission assignments | Minimize |
| Deviation | Extra permissions not covered by assigned roles | < 5% |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Extract User-Permission Data

Collect the current access state from all identity sources:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load user-permission assignments
# Format: user_id, permission_id (one row per assignment)
assignments = pd.read_csv("user_permissions.csv")

# Create binary user-permission matrix (UPA matrix)
upa_matrix = assignments.pivot_table(
    index="user_id",
    columns="permission_id",
    aggfunc="size",
    fill_value=0
)
upa_matrix = (upa_matrix > 0).astype(int)

print(f"Users: {upa_matrix.shape[0]}")
print(f"Permissions: {upa_matrix.shape[1]}")
print(f"Assignments: {assignments.shape[0]}")
print(f"Density: {upa_matrix.values.sum() / upa_matrix.size:.2%}")
```

### Step 2: Bottom-Up Role Discovery Using Clustering

```python
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

def find_optimal_clusters(matrix, max_k=50):
    """Find optimal number of roles using silhouette analysis."""
    scores = []
    for k in range(2, min(max_k, matrix.shape[0])):
        clustering = AgglomerativeClustering(
            n_clusters=k, metric="jaccard", linkage="average"
        )
        labels = clustering.fit_predict(matrix)
        score = silhouette_score(matrix, labels, metric="jaccard")
        scores.append((k, score))

    optimal_k = max(scores, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
    return optimal_k, scores

def mine_roles_clustering(upa_matrix, n_clusters):
    """Mine roles using hierarchical clustering on Jaccard distance."""
    clustering = AgglomerativeClustering(
        n_clusters=n_clusters, metric="jaccard", linkage="average"
    )
    user_matrix = upa_matrix.values
    labels = clustering.fit_predict(user_matrix)

    roles = {}
    for cluster_id in range(n_clusters):
        cluster_users = upa_matrix.index[labels == cluster_id]
        cluster_permissions = upa_matrix.loc[cluster_users]

        # Core role = permissions held by >80% of cluster members
        permission_frequency = cluster_permissions.mean()
        core_permissions = permission_frequency[permission_frequency >= 0.8].index.tolist()

        roles[f"Role_{cluster_id}"] = {
            "permissions": core_permissions,
            "user_count": len(cluster_users),
            "users": cluster_users.tolist(),
            "coverage": permission_frequency[permission_frequency >= 0.8].mean()
        }

    return roles, labels
```

### Step 3: Formal Concept Analysis

```python
def mine_roles_fca(upa_matrix, min_support=3):
    """Mine roles using Formal Concept Analysis (frequent closed itemsets)."""
    from itertools import combinations

    users = upa_matrix.index.tolist()
    permissions = upa_matrix.columns.tolist()

    concepts = []

    # Find all maximal permission sets shared by at least min_support users
    for size in range(len(permissions), 0, -1):
        for perm_combo in combinations(permissions, size):
            perm_set = set(perm_combo)
            # Find users who have ALL permissions in this set
            matching_users = []
            for user in users:
                user_perms = set(upa_matrix.columns[upa_matrix.loc[user] == 1])
                if perm_set.issubset(user_perms):
                    matching_users.append(user)

            if len(matching_users) >= min_support:
                # Check if this is a closed concept (no superset with same extent)
                is_closed = True
                for concept in concepts:
                    if set(matching_users) == set(concept["users"]) and \
                       perm_set.issubset(set(concept["permissions"])):
                        is_closed = False
                        break

                if is_closed:
                    concepts.append({
                        "permissions": list(perm_set),
                        "users": matching_users,
                        "support": len(matching_users)
                    })

        if len(concepts) > 100:  # Limit for performance
            break

    return concepts
```

### Step 4: Evaluate and Select Roles

```python
def evaluate_role_set(roles, upa_matrix):
    """Evaluate the quality of a mined role set."""
    total_assignments = upa_matrix.values.sum()
    covered_assignments = 0
    extra_assignments = 0

    for role_name, role_data in roles.items():
        role_perms = set(role_data["permissions"])
        for user in role_data["users"]:
            user_perms = set(upa_matrix.columns[upa_matrix.loc[user] == 1])
            covered = role_perms.intersection(user_perms)
            extra = role_perms - user_perms
            covered_assignments += len(covered)
            extra_assignments += len(extra)

    metrics = {
        "total_roles": len(roles),
        "total_assignments": total_assignments,
        "covered_assignments": covered_assignments,
        "coverage_rate": covered_assignments / total_assignments if total_assignments else 0,
        "extra_permissions": extra_assignments,
        "deviation_rate": extra_assignments / (covered_assignments + extra_assignments) if (covered_assignments + extra_assignments) else 0,
        "avg_role_size": np.mean([len(r["permissions"]) for r in roles.values()]),
        "avg_users_per_role": np.mean([r["user_count"] for r in roles.values()]),
    }
    return metrics
```

### Step 5: Business Validation

After mining candidate roles:

1. Map mined roles to business functions (department, job title)
2. Conduct workshops with business unit managers to validate role definitions
3. Identify outlier permissions that indicate misconfiguration
4. Refine roles based on feedback and re-evaluate metrics
5. Document role definitions with business justification
