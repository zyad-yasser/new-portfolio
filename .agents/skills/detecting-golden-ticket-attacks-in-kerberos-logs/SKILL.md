# Detecting Golden Ticket Attacks in Kerberos Logs

## When to Use

- When KRBTGT account hash may have been compromised via DCSync or NTDS.dit extraction
- When hunting for forged Kerberos tickets used for persistent domain access
- After incident response reveals credential theft at the domain level
- When investigating impossible logon patterns (users logging in from multiple locations simultaneously)
- During post-breach assessment to determine if Golden Tickets are in use

## Prerequisites

- Windows Security Event IDs 4768, 4769, 4771 on domain controllers
- Kerberos policy configuration knowledge (max ticket lifetime, encryption types)
- Domain controller audit policy enabling Kerberos Service Ticket Operations
- SIEM with ability to correlate Kerberos events across multiple DCs

## Workflow

1. **Monitor TGT Requests (Event 4768)**: Track Kerberos authentication service requests. Golden Tickets bypass the AS-REQ/AS-REP exchange entirely, so the absence of 4768 before 4769 is suspicious.
2. **Detect Encryption Type Anomalies**: Golden Tickets often use RC4 (0x17) encryption. If your domain enforces AES (0x12), any RC4 TGT is a red flag. Monitor TicketEncryptionType in Event 4769.
3. **Check Ticket Lifetime Anomalies**: Default Kerberos TGT lifetime is 10 hours with 7-day renewal. Golden Tickets can be forged with 10-year lifetimes. Detect tickets with durations exceeding policy.
4. **Hunt for Non-Existent SIDs**: Golden Tickets can include arbitrary SIDs (including non-existent accounts or groups). Correlate TGS requests against known AD SID inventory.
5. **Detect TGS Without Prior TGT**: When a service ticket (4769) appears without a preceding TGT request (4768) from the same IP/account, this may indicate a pre-existing Golden Ticket.
6. **Monitor KRBTGT Password Age**: Track when KRBTGT was last reset. If KRBTGT hash hasn't changed since a known compromise, Golden Tickets from that period remain valid.
7. **Validate PAC Signatures**: With KB5008380+ and PAC validation enforcement, domain controllers reject forged PACs. Monitor for Kerberos failures indicating PAC validation errors.

## Detection Queries

### Splunk -- RC4 Encryption in Kerberos TGS
```spl
index=wineventlog EventCode=4769
| where TicketEncryptionType="0x17"
| where ServiceName!="krbtgt"
| stats count by TargetUserName ServiceName IpAddress TicketEncryptionType Computer
| where count > 5
| sort -count
```

### Splunk -- TGS Without Prior TGT
```spl
index=wineventlog (EventCode=4768 OR EventCode=4769)
| stats earliest(_time) as first_tgt by TargetUserName IpAddress EventCode
| eventstats earliest(eval(if(EventCode=4768, first_tgt, null()))) as tgt_time by TargetUserName IpAddress
| where EventCode=4769 AND (isnull(tgt_time) OR first_tgt < tgt_time)
| table TargetUserName IpAddress first_tgt tgt_time
```

### KQL -- Golden Ticket Indicators
```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4769
| where TicketEncryptionType == "0x17"
| where ServiceName != "krbtgt"
| summarize Count=count() by TargetUserName, IpAddress, ServiceName
| where Count > 5
```

## Common Scenarios

1. **Post-DCSync Golden Ticket**: After extracting KRBTGT hash, attacker forges TGT with Domain Admin SID, valid for months until KRBTGT is rotated twice.
2. **RC4 Downgrade**: Golden Ticket forged with RC4 encryption in an AES-only environment, detectable by encryption type mismatch.
3. **Cross-Domain Golden Ticket**: Forged inter-realm TGT used to pivot between AD domains/forests.
4. **Persistence After Remediation**: Golden Tickets surviving password resets because KRBTGT was only rotated once (both current and previous hashes are valid).
