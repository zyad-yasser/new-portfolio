# Deploying Ransomware Canary Files

## When to Use

- Deploying proactive ransomware detection on file servers, NAS devices, or endpoint systems
- Building an early-warning system that detects ransomware before it encrypts business-critical data
- Supplementing EDR solutions with lightweight canary file monitoring on systems where agents cannot be deployed
- Testing ransomware incident response procedures by simulating canary file triggers
- Monitoring shared drives, home directories, and backup volumes for unauthorized file operations

**Do not use** as a replacement for endpoint protection, backup strategy, or network segmentation. Canary files are a detection layer, not a prevention mechanism.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ with pip
- watchdog library (pip install watchdog)
- Write access to directories where canary files will be placed
- SMTP server credentials or Slack webhook URL for alerting
- Administrative access for placing canaries in system directories

## Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Canary Files

Create decoy files with realistic names and content that attract ransomware scanners. Files should have names like `Passwords.xlsx`, `Financial_Report_2026.docx`, `backup_credentials.csv` and contain plausible-looking but fake data. Place them in directories ransomware typically targets first: user desktops, Documents folders, network share roots, and backup paths.

### Step 2: Deploy Filesystem Monitor

Use Python's watchdog library with a custom `FileSystemEventHandler` that watches canary file paths. The handler triggers on `on_modified`, `on_deleted`, `on_moved`, and `on_created` events for canary files. Any legitimate user or process should never touch these files, so any interaction is a high-confidence indicator of ransomware or unauthorized access.

### Step 3: Configure Alert Pipeline

Wire the filesystem monitor to multiple alert channels: email via SMTP, Slack webhook POST, syslog forwarding to SIEM, and local log file. Include the triggering event type, file path, timestamp, and process information (when available) in alert payloads.

### Step 4: Validate and Test

Simulate ransomware behavior by programmatically modifying, renaming, and deleting canary files to verify the detection pipeline fires correctly. Measure time-to-alert and validate alert delivery across all configured channels.

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Canary File** | A decoy file placed in a monitored directory that triggers an alert when accessed, modified, or deleted |
| **Watchdog** | Python library that monitors filesystem events using OS-native APIs (inotify on Linux, FSEvents on macOS, ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows) |
| **Honey File** | Synonym for canary file; a fake document designed to attract and detect malicious activity |
| **Entropy Check** | Measuring randomness in file content to detect encryption (ransomware produces high-entropy output) |

## Tools & Systems

- **watchdog**: Python filesystem monitoring library using OS-native event APIs
- **smtplib**: Python standard library for SMTP email alerting
- **requests**: HTTP library for Slack webhook integration
- **hashlib**: SHA-256 hashing for canary file integrity verification
- **psutil**: Process information gathering when canary file access is detected

## Output Format

```
