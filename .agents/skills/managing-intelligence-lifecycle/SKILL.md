# Managing Intelligence Lifecycle

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Establishing a formal CTI program and defining its operational model
- Conducting quarterly intelligence requirements reviews with business stakeholders
- Evaluating CTI program maturity against established frameworks (FIRST CTI-SIG maturity model)

**Do not use** this skill for day-to-day IOC triage or incident-specific intelligence tasks — those use operational intelligence workflows, not lifecycle management.

## Prerequisites

- Executive sponsorship and defined CTI team structure (1+ dedicated analysts)
- Stakeholder map identifying intelligence consumers (SOC, IR, executive team, vulnerability management)
- Existing feed subscriptions or ISAC memberships for collection baseline
- CTI platform (MISP, ThreatConnect, OpenCTI) for lifecycle management

## Workflow

### Step 1: Planning and Direction

Define Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) with stakeholders:
- Interview SOC leads, IR team, CISO, risk management, and product security
- Document PIRs in structured format: "What is the current capability and intent of [threat actor] to attack [critical asset] using [technique]?"
- Prioritize 5–10 PIRs for the quarter, reviewed monthly

Example PIR: "Is ransomware group Cl0p currently targeting organizations in our sector using MoveIT or GoAnywhere vulnerabilities?"

### Step 2: Collection Planning

Map PIRs to required collection sources:
- Technical sources: commercial feeds, TAXII, ISAC data, honeypot telemetry, darkweb monitoring
- Human sources: vendor threat briefings, industry working groups, law enforcement partnerships
- Internal sources: SIEM logs, EDR telemetry, phishing submission mailbox

Document collection gaps and associated costs to fill them.

### Step 3: Processing and Normalization

Implement automated processing pipeline:
- Ingest → normalize to STIX 2.1 → deduplicate → enrich → score confidence
- Reject unverifiable or duplicate indicators before analysis
- Tag all processed data with source, collection date, and expiration

### Step 4: Analysis and Production

Produce intelligence at three levels:
- **Strategic**: Quarterly threat landscape report for executives; sector trends, geopolitical context
- **Operational**: Weekly campaign reports for security leadership; active campaigns, adversary activity
- **Tactical**: Daily IOC bulletins for SOC; actionable indicators with block/monitor recommendations

Apply structured analytic techniques: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH), Key Assumptions Check, Devil's Advocacy.

### Step 5: Dissemination

Match product format to audience:
- Executives: 1-page PDF with risk ratings, business impact, recommended decisions
- SOC analysts: SIEM-ready IOC list, Sigma rules, MISP events
- Vulnerability management: CVE lists with EPSS scores and exploitation likelihood
- IT/Security leadership: Full intelligence report with technical appendix

Apply TLP classifications and distribution lists per product type.

### Step 6: Feedback and Evaluation

Collect feedback within 5 business days of dissemination:
- Did the product address the PIR?
- Was actionability sufficient?
- What data was missing?

Track metrics quarterly: PIR coverage rate, IOC true positive rate, time-to-disseminate, stakeholder satisfaction score (NPS or structured survey).

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **PIR** | Priority Intelligence Requirement — specific, actionable question driving intelligence collection and analysis |
| **Intelligence Lifecycle** | Six-phase iterative process: Planning → Collection → Processing → Analysis → Dissemination → Feedback |
| **Strategic Intelligence** | Long-term threat trend analysis for executive decision-making; time horizon 6–24 months |
| **Operational Intelligence** | Campaign-level analysis for security program decisions; time horizon 1–6 months |
| **Tactical Intelligence** | Specific IOCs and TTPs for immediate detection and blocking; time horizon hours to days |
| **FIRST CTI-SIG** | Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams — CTI Special Interest Group maturity model |

## Tools & Systems

- **ThreatConnect**: TIP with built-in intelligence lifecycle workflows, PIR tracking, and stakeholder reporting dashboards
- **MISP**: Open-source TIP supporting intelligence lifecycle from collection through sharing
- **OpenCTI**: Graph-based CTI platform with workflow management for intelligence products
- **Recorded Future**: Commercial platform with structured intelligence reports aligned to the intelligence lifecycle

## Common Pitfalls

- **Collection without direction**: Ingesting every available feed without PIRs produces data overload and no actionable intelligence.
- **Missing feedback loops**: Without structured feedback, CTI teams produce reports that don't meet stakeholder needs and lose organizational relevance.
- **Tactical-only focus**: Overemphasis on IOC sharing neglects strategic intelligence that informs security investment and risk decisions.
- **No metrics program**: Cannot demonstrate CTI program value without tracking detection contributions, true positive rates, and stakeholder satisfaction.
- **Underfunded collection**: PIRs cannot be answered without appropriate collection sources; document and escalate gaps rather than producing low-confidence estimates.
