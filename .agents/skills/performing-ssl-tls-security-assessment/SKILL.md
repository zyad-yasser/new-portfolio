# Performing SSL/TLS Security Assessment

## Overview

Assess SSL/TLS server configurations using sslyze, a fast Python-based scanning library. This skill covers evaluating supported protocol versions (SSLv2/3, TLS 1.0-1.3), cipher suite strength, certificate chain validation, HSTS enforcement, OCSP stapling, and scanning for known vulnerabilities including Heartbleed, ROBOT, and session renegotiation weaknesses.


## When to Use

- When conducting security assessments that involve performing ssl tls security assessment
- When following incident response procedures for related security events
- When performing scheduled security testing or auditing activities
- When validating security controls through hands-on testing

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ with `sslyze` library (pip install sslyze)
- Network access to target HTTPS servers on port 443
- Understanding of TLS protocol versions and cipher suite classifications

## Steps

### Step 1: Configure Server Scan
Create ServerScanRequest with ServerNetworkLocation specifying target hostname and port.

### Step 2: Execute TLS Scan
Use sslyze Scanner to queue and execute scans for all TLS check commands concurrently.

### Step 3: Analyze Results
Evaluate accepted cipher suites, certificate validity, protocol versions, and vulnerability scan results.

### Step 4: Generate Security Report
Produce a JSON report with compliance findings and remediation recommendations.

## Expected Output

JSON report with supported protocols, accepted cipher suites, certificate details, vulnerability results (Heartbleed, ROBOT), and HSTS status.
