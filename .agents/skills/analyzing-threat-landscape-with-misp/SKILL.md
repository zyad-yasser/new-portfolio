description: Analyze the threat landscape using MISP (Malware Information Sharing
  Platform) by querying event statistics, attribute distributions, threat actor galaxy
  clusters, and tag trends over time. Uses PyMISP to pull event data, compute IOC
  type breakdowns, identify top threat actors and malware families, and generate threat
  landscape reports with temporal trends.

# Analyzing Threat Landscape with MISP


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing threat landscape with misp
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with threat intelligence concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `pip install pymisp`
2. Configure MISP URL and API key.
3. Run the agent to generate threat landscape analysis:
   - Pull event statistics by threat level and date range
   - Analyze attribute type distributions (IP, domain, hash, URL)
   - Identify top MITRE ATT&CK techniques from event tags
   - Track threat actor activity via galaxy clusters
   - Generate temporal trend analysis of IOC submissions

```bash
python scripts/agent.py --misp-url https://misp.local --api-key YOUR_KEY --days 90 --output landscape_report.json
```

## Examples

### Threat Landscape Summary
```
Period: Last 90 days
Events analyzed: 1,247
Top threat level: High (43%)
Top attribute type: ip-dst (31%), domain (22%), sha256 (18%)
Top MITRE technique: T1566 Phishing (89 events)
Top threat actor: APT28 (34 events)
```
