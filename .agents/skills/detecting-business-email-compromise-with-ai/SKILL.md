# Detecting Business Email Compromise with AI

## Overview
AI-powered BEC detection uses machine learning, NLP, and behavioral analytics to identify sophisticated impersonation attacks that contain no malicious links or attachments. Traditional rule-based filters miss these attacks because BEC relies purely on social engineering. Modern AI approaches analyze writing style, tone, vocabulary, grammatical patterns, and behavioral context to determine if an email genuinely comes from the stated sender. BERT-based models achieve 98.65% accuracy in BEC detection, and AI-enhanced platforms show a 25% increase in phishing identification over keyword-based rules.


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require detecting business email compromise with ai
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites
- AI-powered email security platform (Abnormal Security, Tessian, Microsoft Defender)
- Historical email data for baseline training (minimum 30 days)
- Integration with email platform (Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace)
- SIEM for alert correlation and investigation
- Understanding of BEC attack types (FBI IC3 classification)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Deploy AI Email Security Platform
- Select API-based solution (Abnormal Security, Tessian, Ironscales) or enhance existing SEG
- Connect to Microsoft Graph API or Google Workspace API
- Allow 48-hour baseline learning period on historical email data
- Configure integration to scan inbound, outbound, and internal email
- Verify API permissions for message access and remediation

### Step 2: Configure Behavioral Baselines
- AI learns normal communication patterns: who emails whom, frequency, tone
- Establish writing style profiles for each user (vocabulary, sentence structure)
- Map typical request types per role (finance processes payments, HR handles PII)
- Baseline email metadata: typical sending times, devices, locations
- Flag deviations from established baselines as anomalous

### Step 3: Train NLP Models for BEC Detection
- Deploy transformer-based models (BERT, GPT) for email content analysis
- Detect urgency and manipulation language patterns
- Identify mismatches between sender identity and writing style
- Analyze sentiment shifts indicating social engineering pressure
- Classify email intent: information request, payment request, credential request

### Step 4: Configure Detection Policies
- VIP impersonation: AI compares new email against known executive communication patterns
- Vendor impersonation: detect payment change requests from vendor lookalike domains
- Account compromise: detect sudden changes in employee email behavior
- Supply chain BEC: monitor for impersonation of trusted partners
- Configure confidence thresholds for auto-block vs. warning banner vs. analyst review

### Step 5: Integrate with Response Workflow
- Auto-quarantine high-confidence BEC detections
- Add warning banners for moderate-confidence detections
- Route suspicious emails to SOC analyst queue for review
- Integrate with SOAR for automated response playbooks
- Feed BEC verdicts back into training data for model improvement

## Tools & Resources
- **Abnormal Security**: API-based AI email security with behavioral analysis
- **Microsoft Defender for O365**: Built-in AI anti-BEC with Impostor Classifier
- **Tessian (Proofpoint)**: AI-powered email security with human layer protection
- **Ironscales**: AI + human-in-the-loop BEC detection
- **Darktrace Email**: Self-learning AI for email threat detection

## Validation
- AI detects test BEC email with no malicious indicators (pure social engineering)
- Writing style analysis identifies impersonation of known executive
- Behavioral baseline flags unusual payment request from compromised account
- NLP correctly classifies urgency manipulation in test scenario
- False positive rate below 0.05% after baseline training
- Detection rate exceeds traditional rule-based filters by 25%+
