# Implementing Patch Management for OT Systems

## When to Use

- When establishing a formal OT patch management program for the first time
- When responding to critical ICS-CERT advisories affecting deployed OT systems
- When preparing for NERC CIP-007-6 or IEC 62443 patch management compliance audits
- When planning patch deployment during limited maintenance windows in continuous operations
- When evaluating compensating controls for systems that cannot be patched

**Do not use** for IT-only patch management without OT considerations, for emergency patching during active cyber incidents (see performing-ot-incident-response), or for firmware upgrades that change PLC functionality (requires separate change management).

## Prerequisites

- OT asset inventory with firmware/OS versions for all patchable systems
- Vendor patch notification subscriptions (Siemens ProductCERT, Rockwell, Schneider, etc.)
- Test/staging environment mirroring production OT systems for patch validation
- Maintenance window schedule aligned with process shutdowns and turnarounds
- Change management board approval process including operations and safety representatives

## Workflow

### Step 1: Establish OT Patch Management Program

Define the patch management lifecycle adapted for OT environments where availability and safety take priority over immediate vulnerability remediation.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""OT Patch Management Program Manager.

Tracks patches for OT systems, manages risk-based prioritization,
coordinates testing and deployment, and documents compensating
controls for unpatchable systems.

### Step 2: Test Patches in Staging Environment

Never deploy patches directly to production OT systems. Use a test environment that mirrors production to validate patch compatibility.

```yaml
# OT Patch Testing Procedure
patch_testing:
  environment:
    description: "Staging lab mirroring production OT architecture"
    components:
      - "Virtual PLC simulators matching production firmware"
      - "Test HMI stations with identical software versions"
      - "Test historian with representative data"
      - "Network configuration matching production VLANs/firewalls"

  test_cases:
    functional:
      - "PLC programs execute correctly after OS patch"
      - "HMI displays update with correct process values"
      - "Historian data collection continues uninterrupted"
      - "Alarm and event handling functions properly"
      - "Communication between PLCs maintains cycle time"
      - "Safety system trip tests pass (if SIS affected)"

    performance:
      - "PLC scan time remains within acceptable limits (<50ms increase)"
      - "HMI screen refresh rate unchanged"
      - "Historian collection interval maintained"
      - "Network latency between zones unchanged"

    compatibility:
      - "Third-party applications function correctly"
      - "OPC UA/DA connections establish successfully"
      - "Custom scripts and batch processes execute"
      - "Backup and restore procedures work"

    rollback:
      - "System can be reverted to pre-patch state"
      - "Rollback procedure documented and tested"
      - "Estimated rollback time: [N] minutes"

  documentation:
    required:
      - "Test plan with pass/fail criteria"
      - "Test execution results with screenshots"
      - "Performance measurements before and after"
      - "Sign-off by operations, engineering, and security"
```

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Compensating Control | Alternative security measure applied when a patch cannot be deployed, such as firewall rules, IPS signatures, or network isolation |
| Vendor Compatibility | Confirmation from the OT vendor that a patch (especially OS patches) is compatible with their control system software |
| Maintenance Window | Scheduled period for system modifications, aligned with process shutdowns or reduced-risk operational periods |
| Virtual Patching | Deploying IDS/IPS rules to detect and block exploitation attempts for known vulnerabilities without modifying the target system |
| Evaluation Deadline | NERC CIP-007-6 requires patch evaluation within 35 calendar days of availability |
| Turnaround | Major scheduled shutdown of a process unit for maintenance, providing opportunity for extensive OT patching |

## Tools & Systems

- **WSUS/SCCM**: Microsoft patch management for Windows-based OT systems (HMIs, historians, engineering workstations)
- **Siemens ProductCERT**: Siemens security advisory service for industrial products
- **Claroty xDome**: OT vulnerability management with patch availability tracking and risk scoring
- **Tripwire Enterprise**: Configuration monitoring detecting unauthorized changes and tracking patch status

## Output Format

```
OT Patch Management Report
============================
Reporting Period: YYYY-MM to YYYY-MM

PATCH STATUS:
  Identified: [N]
  Evaluating: [N]
  Testing: [N]
  Deployed: [N]
  Deferred: [N]

COMPLIANCE:
  Evaluated within 35 days: [N]/[N] (CIP-007-6 R2)
  Deployed or mitigated: [N]/[N]
  Deferred with compensating controls: [N]
```
