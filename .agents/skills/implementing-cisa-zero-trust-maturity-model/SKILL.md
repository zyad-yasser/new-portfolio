# Implementing CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model

## Overview

The CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM) Version 2.0, released in April 2023, provides federal agencies and organizations with a structured roadmap for adopting zero trust architecture. The model defines five core pillars -- Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications & Workloads, and Data -- each progressing through four maturity stages: Traditional, Initial, Advanced, and Optimal. Three cross-cutting capabilities (Visibility and Analytics, Automation and Orchestration, and Governance) span all pillars. This skill covers assessment, gap analysis, and progressive implementation across all pillars and maturity levels.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing cisa zero trust maturity model capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture
- Understanding of federal cybersecurity mandates (EO 14028, OMB M-22-09)
- Access to organizational IT asset inventory and network architecture documentation
- Knowledge of identity and access management (IAM) fundamentals
- Understanding of network segmentation and microsegmentation concepts

## CISA ZTMM Five Pillars

### Pillar 1: Identity

Identity refers to attributes that uniquely describe an agency user or entity, including non-person entities (NPEs) such as service accounts and machine identities.

**Traditional Stage:**
- Password-based authentication
- Limited identity validation
- Manual provisioning and deprovisioning

**Initial Stage:**
- MFA deployed for privileged users
- Identity governance initiated
- Basic identity lifecycle management

**Advanced Stage:**
- Phishing-resistant MFA for all users (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- Continuous identity validation
- Automated provisioning tied to HR systems
- Identity threat detection and response (ITDR)

**Optimal Stage:**
- Continuous, real-time identity verification
- Passwordless authentication across all systems
- AI-driven anomaly detection for identity behaviors
- Full integration of identity signals into access decisions

### Pillar 2: Devices

Devices include any hardware, software, or firmware asset that connects to a network -- servers, laptops, mobile phones, IoT devices, and network equipment.

**Traditional Stage:**
- Limited device inventory
- Basic endpoint protection (antivirus)
- No device compliance checks

**Initial Stage:**
- Comprehensive device inventory
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) deployment
- Basic device health checks before network access

**Advanced Stage:**
- Real-time device posture assessment
- Automated compliance enforcement
- Device certificates for machine identity
- Vulnerability scanning integrated into access decisions

**Optimal Stage:**
- Continuous device trust scoring
- Automated remediation of non-compliant devices
- Full device lifecycle management integrated with zero trust policies
- Firmware integrity verification

### Pillar 3: Networks

Networks encompass all communications media including internal networks, wireless, and the internet.

**Traditional Stage:**
- Perimeter-based security (firewalls, VPNs)
- Flat internal networks
- Minimal east-west traffic inspection

**Initial Stage:**
- Initial network segmentation
- Encrypted DNS and internal traffic
- Basic network monitoring and logging

**Advanced Stage:**
- Microsegmentation of critical assets
- Software-defined networking (SDN) for dynamic policy enforcement
- Full TLS encryption for all internal communications
- Network Detection and Response (NDR)

**Optimal Stage:**
- Fully software-defined, policy-driven network
- Zero implicit trust zones
- AI-driven network anomaly detection
- Automated threat response integrated with network controls

### Pillar 4: Applications and Workloads

Applications and workloads include agency systems, programs, and services running on-premises, on mobile devices, and in cloud environments.

**Traditional Stage:**
- Perimeter-protected applications
- Manual vulnerability patching
- Limited application-level logging

**Initial Stage:**
- Application-level access controls
- Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Application inventory established

**Advanced Stage:**
- Continuous integration of security testing (SAST/DAST)
- Application-aware microsegmentation
- API security gateways
- Immutable infrastructure patterns

**Optimal Stage:**
- Runtime application self-protection (RASP)
- Automated application security orchestration
- Full DevSecOps pipeline integration
- Zero-standing privileges for application access

### Pillar 5: Data

Data encompasses all structured and unstructured information, at rest, in transit, and in use.

**Traditional Stage:**
- Basic encryption for data at rest
- Limited data classification
- No data loss prevention

**Initial Stage:**
- Data classification scheme implemented
- DLP policies for sensitive data
- Encryption for data in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Basic data inventory

**Advanced Stage:**
- Automated data classification
- Fine-grained data access controls
- Data activity monitoring
- Rights management for sensitive documents

**Optimal Stage:**
- Real-time data flow analytics
- AI-driven data classification and protection
- Automated response to data exfiltration attempts
- Full data lifecycle governance with zero trust principles

## Cross-Cutting Capabilities

### Visibility and Analytics

```
Maturity Progression:
Traditional -> Manual log review, limited SIEM
Initial     -> Centralized logging, basic SIEM correlation
Advanced    -> UEBA, automated threat detection, data lake analytics
Optimal     -> AI/ML-driven continuous monitoring, predictive analytics
```

### Automation and Orchestration

```
Maturity Progression:
Traditional -> Manual incident response, ad-hoc scripts
Initial     -> Basic SOAR playbooks, automated alerting
Advanced    -> Integrated SOAR with multi-pillar orchestration
Optimal     -> Fully autonomous response, self-healing infrastructure
```

### Governance

```
Maturity Progression:
Traditional -> Ad-hoc policies, manual compliance checks
Initial     -> Documented zero trust strategy, basic policy framework
Advanced    -> Policy-as-code, continuous compliance monitoring
Optimal     -> Dynamic policy engine, real-time governance decisions
```

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Assessment and Baseline

1. **Inventory all assets** across the five pillars
2. **Map current capabilities** to ZTMM maturity stages
3. **Conduct gap analysis** between current and target states
4. **Identify quick wins** that move from Traditional to Initial stage
5. **Document dependencies** between pillars
